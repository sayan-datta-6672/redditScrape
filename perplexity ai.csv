1,"Hey guys, after all the love and support I've received from you, I've doubled down on my open-source perplexity project, which I'm calling Omniplex. So here is a bit more context.

Also here is a broken link pre-view to try: [https://omniplex-v2.vercel.app/](https://omniplex-v2.vercel.app/)

I've completed my work for:

1. Streaming text
2. Formatted responses
3. Citations and websites

Currently, I'm working on finishing:

1. Chat history
2. Documents library
3. LLM settings

I'm using the Vercel AI SDK, Next.js, Firebase, and Bing to ensure setting up and running the project is as straightforward as possible. I hope to support more LLMs, like Claude, Mistral, and Gemini, to offer a mix-and-match approach.

Although I've accomplished a lot, there are still a few more weeks of work ahead. Unfortunately, I've failed to raise any funds for my project and am fully dependent on the open-source community for support.

**Note: VCs told me I can't build perplexity so simply because I don't have that much skills or high enough pedigree. They are literally blinded by the fact that any average dev can also build such an app.**"
2,"looks like a great UI, I like it :)"
3,This looks promising. Nice work and nice demo
4,Where‚Äôs the link to your repo?

Saw perplexity for the first time, and felt i know how to do that.

Booted up my idle Raspberry Pi and did some experiments to run all under a Cloudflare tunnel.

  
I could simulate an easy lightweight alternate to perplexity in few hours.

34,Just tried it out and so far the results are fairly mixed in quality but very good for the first pass. I‚Äôm sure with enough iterations and fine-tuning it will be much much better. The UI however is very much on point!

39,lol fuck VCs they're like consultants they make you feel like something is wrong and the solution is MONEY or their services. Indie devs can do a lot in the AI age.

127,For sure
128,I agree i just tried pro and it is simply not following the simplest prompt. I put the same prompt in clause ans instantly it did what I wanted.
129,"In what use cases? When I've tried some contrived search examples to test it out, I found it slow and lacking -- worse at what I use google or google maps for, and worse at what I use chatGPT for."
130,"Perplexity ai isn't intended to be some sort of chatgpt alternative, it's a search engine similar to bing ai that answers your natural language questions and then shows the sources."
131,"If you want it to do stuff without the perplexityness, you have to select writing."
132,Are you still using it now (Mar-24)? If yes would you mind sharing it is now? I'm curious because I've been trying with the free version and it's working fine for me. Maybe I haven't tried many prompts so my experience with it is limited compare to yours.
133,I  not. I have since switched to Poe and really like it.
134,Thanks for the in-depth review . I have used Perplexity Ai I was impressed in its academic accuracy compared to ChatGPT
135,"Besides coding, how does it compare to phind? In my evaluation, I discovered that phind frequently presents false information that isn't even in the sources it cited. But perplexity can also be inconsistent, as you mentioned and it provides alot of outdated info. Additionally, it mixes up information from different sources, leading to confusion and only acknowledges one source. In the end I came to the conclusion that phind is for finding and summarizing search results about obscure stuff and the latest information about something. While perplexity is better for popular topics."
136,"**TL;DR** Perplexity AI excels in coding with online sources, solving hard math problems with the help of WolframAlpha, offering specific search modes, effectively searching Reddit, finding local companies, and providing concise responses. However, it falls short in complicated science outside of math, lacks problem-solving capabilities, sometimes provides inconsistent and short responses, and has limitations in search breadth and formatting. Despite its limitations, Perplexity AI is worth trying, especially when combined with other AI models for better information accuracy."
137,"Thank you for the review!

I think it now has a copilot(gpt4, rate limited to 5 in 4 hours) mode, which does a great job - but i think bing does a much better job!


Are there any usage limits for this? How is the company making money?"
138,2024 update: It can solve the chemistry problem now.
139,"hi guys, here is the promotional link of $10 for perplexity pro, believe me, it's worth it

[https://perplexity.ai/pro?referral\_code=QZC6SL6Y](https://perplexity.ai/pro?referral_code=QZC6SL6Y)"
140,"I'm using Pro, it's much better with all integrated pro ai like gpt4, claude sonnet, sonar and mistral large."
141,"Yeah, I will also be doing more reviews for other AI in the future."
142,"Yeah I will create an analysis for phind as well.
Especially with the release of Copilot is seems to be more even between the two. I think phind is better for deep, deep searches but sometimes doesn't document which sources it is pulling from and if it uses the GPT 3.5 turbo model's library or sources."
143,Is perplexity AI good for basic science questions when a person is learning about medical theory in medical school?
144,Yeah it's a lot better now.
145,"So, what's your opinion on phind? It can use GPT4, and a mode called copilot"
146,"This 8sny exactly the same, but I've been using it for help with my insurance licensing study - this will sound like an echo of the op, but I'll often get results like 'the answer isn't explicitly stated in search results, but [ANSWER] appears frequently on sites like x,y,z.' 

Useful as a study aid, but I wouldn't take exams with it."
147,I just started playing around with it. No account - no sign-up. Am I actually limited to 5 queries every 4 hours? It seems like I can do more.
148,For Copilot.
149,Hey OP u/JueDarvyTheCatMaster Would be grateful if you could make a post again as per current perplexity version? Since it's been a while since your original post
150,"I love perplexity, but it‚Äôs much more likely that Google is going to switch their search model to something more similar. They already have actually, you get the ai response at the top now if you opt into it. Much more basic, but they‚Äôre heading that direction already. Tbh I don‚Äôt really think perplexity has a chance long run, then again Google is bloated and already missed the mark big time with AI - although they do appear to be course correcting majorly instead of burying their head in the sand."
151,Long way to go
152,"I've pretty much stopped using Google because why would I since I can just ask Perplexity any question. I get great links and a summarization all with no ads. This is how search was always supposed  to be if you ask me.  Internet feels like it's really coming into its own at last, like it's moving out of toddler stage. Having said that, Google will try and be competitive so they will turn their search interface into something like Perplexity I assume. I just don't know how they will incorporate ads into that, if they retain that model. If they go for a subscription model, will there be a two tiered search? Then you have inequality as far as access to knowledge and so on. It's going to be interesting to see how it unfolds. I know they see the cards on the table. We are watching the AI race to dominate ramp up, and Google has a head start as far as resources to get behind roll outs. Still, no one is King forever."
153,"I‚Äôve replaced Google with Perplexity. And I use a ton of other AI too. But Google will easily adapt. I wasn‚Äôt sure why I needed Perplexity when I have so much AI already, but it‚Äôs instant speed for questions makes it have its own niche as an AI search engine imo."
154,I tried perplexity but the llm seems to get only 5 most relevant websites and produce the answer based on that. The answer seems very shallow. Any idea how to fix this?
155,"Perplexity was very useful when ChatGPT didn‚Äôt have the ability to provide information past a cutoff date, but now that it and other services have the ability to search the web for answers, it quickly lost its value imo. Honestly, I find bing search to work really well. I search, and if I don‚Äôt want to read through the results, I just let copilot give me the answer. I‚Äôm sure Google does the same thing."
156,I like Google searching I end up learning a lot of things in the journey of learning what I want to learn
157,"In simply terms, no."
158,"Some of my main reasons for using Google are shopping and live news/sports news, which Perplexity doesn‚Äôt do very well currently. Similarly it can‚Äôt identify plants/ images or songs (which Google can). I like Perplexity, but it‚Äôll only be a supplementary app rather than a replacement for me until it can do those things."
159,"In the long term, Perplexity will face significant challenges. Take a look at this [analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1bh6o3e/reverse_engineering_perplexity/), which suggests that Perplexity may rely on the Google Search Engine in its backend operations. Tbh Perplexity currently has no alternative but to utilize Serpapis for retrieving search results from platforms like Google and Bing. However, it's crucial to note that Serpapis only provide tip of the iceberg, Google has access to what's underneath to organize a better result than Perplexity.

Hence, Google possesses the capability to develop an answering engine vastly superior to Perplexity, whether one believes it or not. Perplexity is currently built around no moat at all. Sure it's an awesome use case of LLMs.

Another critical aspect to consider here. Let's assume, if Google were to cease its operations today, granting Perplexity access to its search engine, could Perplexity sustain the global mass traffic of a knowledge engine powered by LLMs for free? Absolutely not. This is also a reason why Google refrains from such idea, as enabling LLM-powered search results for everyone would incur massive per search-query compute cost."
160,"I've been using all the major chatbots for personal, work and research and putting the same prompts into them.  I sort of blew off Perplexity as sort of an overhyped, faddish attempt at replacing the need to use a search engine so I never used it until now. Started testing it a few days ago and I'm now a Pro subscriber.  I've run all kinds of prompts through CoPilot (GPT-4), Claude 3 Opus (via pay as you go developer console), Gemni Ultra (via 2-month trial) and Gemini Pro 1.0 (current free public) and Gemini Pro 1.5 (via Vertex AI developer API).  For ""real world"" use, Perplexity is amazing. I'm using Google Search about 75% less. CoPilot is second, and first as far as free tools. Gemini is a joke. Google is still way behind. The benchmark scores are practically useless for evaluating how useful these bots are for day-to-day real world use.

Claude 3 Opus was my preferred bot prior to Perplexity AI Pro.  It had two issue though: (a) can't access web search to get data beyond their current August 2023 cutoff (Copilot and Gemini don't have this issue), and (b) it doesn't give data source citation links so you can easily verify and when you ask for them it hallucinates a lot.

I have Perplexity Pro set to use Claude 3 Opus as the model and it solves the issues of both (a) and (b).  You can also set it to GPT-4-Turbo which in a minority of circumstances may perform even better.

One great way to test these bots is prompt it for information about things you already have deep/expert knowledge in.  Like for instance I've done 200+ hours of research in the past two years on a couple particular areas of medical/health research. So I know all the clinical trial results.  I can prompt it to find and summarize studies by specific criteria and easily see which bot is ""smartest.""  Or where I live, I know all the best Happy Hour spots with the best deals.  I can prompt each model to list the ""best happy hours"" in my city and see which one can uncover the ones the locals already know are the best ones.  In both these cases, and MANY others, Perplexity Pro set to use Claude 3 Opus had much better responses than anything else to the point it made doing a Google search completely pointless.  And the way it asks questions to help refine your prompt before it answers is really useful.

While traveling though Microsoft CoPilot (free) has an edge.  It lists TripAdvisor citations (and sometimes other travel sites) that were included in part of the data it used to respond so it's really convenient to just click on them to dig deeper on a given tourist attraction, restaurant, or whatever.

So while there isn't a tool that does EVERYTHING better than all the other models.  Currently based on personal experience, [Perplexity.ai](http://Perplexity.ai) Pro using the Claude 3 Opus or GPT-4-Turbo models, comes the closest.  Things have been changing so rapidly, this may have not been the case 2 or 3 months ago.

As others have commented, I would expect eventually Google will merge Gemini with its Search Engine and operate more in the way [Perplexity.ai](http://Perplexity.ai) works. Due to their much larger web scrape database they use for their search engine, they could eventually leapfrog Perplexity.  It was recently announced though that Perplexity is getting another Billion in funding which I believe is primarily coming from Jeff Bezos.  He must be seeing what I'm seeing.  The Founder of Perplexity came from OpenAI.  Based on how well his product works, the guy's a genius in my opinion.  And I vowed I'd never pay for any AI subscription with so many free tools out there.  If I didn't want to pay, I'd use Microsoft CoPilot as my primary bot."
161,Not until Perplexity can answer what the weather is going to be like today or tomorrow. It sucks at that. I still use Google for such queries.
162,"[Here](Perplexity, Copilot, You.com: Putting the AI search engines to the test - The Verge
https://www.theverge.com/24111326/ai-search-perplexity-copilot-you-google-review) is a great article about the future of traditional search engines vs. AI search and I've found it compelling.
I have both google and perplexity widgets on my home screen. If I know what I want to know exactly like a Football match time or the weather I use Google; when I have a series of questions about a topic to get informed or familiar with, I use perplexity."
163,Bad for deep dives and longer research sessions
164,As long as Perplexity Models will keep generating 'Lay Ahead' 'Challenges' 'a testament' 'Determination' no... We are still far from perfection.
165,"it's all about how personalised they can make users search experiences. You can even train them for your specific search intents. Like [Olio](https://app.otio.ai//?ref=1) is where it's at, if users spent long enough you're pretty much able to create your own in depth information centre. Perplexity is brilliant for targeting unique search needs and we are greatful cos many keep it up?!

It's the initial search Perplexity is but instead, it's the interactive personally curated library - eventually you won't even need to search online too often because you can link in enough info to Olio and just have your personal information centre that's interactive and understands your needs based on what you pick to upload. If Google doesn't seek to achieve the same strenmgth then and redesigns their approach to user search inputs, LLM will take over. Long tail key words, they exist, and marketers LOVE them because they take users to them, not where users are intending to go. LLM are very good at understanding Long-tail key words, allowing for a more personalised and web experience and most importantly for me, streamlines quick access. I genuinely get frustrated with google because I am not a silly person, I did want what I searched thank you, but google gave me what it want's instead. Google Analytics is a perfect example actually, you search it and it's like 4th or 5th down google. All the top one's are google analytics how to guides, I didn't want a guide!"
166,"Bruh perplexity is a product which is just a wrapper around existing llms, and uses Google search results itself to provide you with an answer. How can it REPLACE google? Are you guys insane lol. There is no ingenuity or innovation here it's just a wrapper."
167,"well honestly perplexity don't have much ""moat"" if you think about it.. combining search results + LLM isn't hard"
168,"YES. use it

169,How do you think their wall of ads will figure into search results?
170,"Found this to be an interesting article. [https://www.theverge.com/24111326/ai-search-perplexity-copilot-you-google-review](https://www.theverge.com/24111326/ai-search-perplexity-copilot-you-google-review) It has a typology, which incudes Navigational Search vs Exploration Search; argues that most searching is done for the former (just give me the link), and google dominates. AI products like perplexity excel at exploratory search, but it's still niche.. Seems to me that google could dominate across all domains of search if they get their sh\*t together on the AI front"
171,"I actually used to find Google search results (including the advertising) to be useful.  But the quality has gone down with the proliferation of SEO.  It destroyed Google.  PPLX could include some advertising and I would still think it is better, provided the ads are tasteful and relevant to the search."
172,Well said. I completely agree.
173,Use Pro mode with GPT-4 Turbo or Claude 3 Opus.
174,This. Copilot works excellent for me. I just don‚Äôt get the Perplexity advantage.
175,It can definitely identify plants and images.
176,"That isn't perplexities main use case, but use the sonar model on labs.pplx.ai and it will gove you that info."
177,Google is not the internet. Perplexity uses its own web crawlers to gather and index information. Perplexity does utilize Google ranking signals to determine website rankings for some topics. It is one of its multiple inputs in which the AI analyses the information. That can be replaced when it no longer serves its purpose. Google in the grand scheme of things is a new thing and can be replaced like it replaced other search engines before it.
178,A wrapper without ads.
179,[deleted]
180,Which one you find better GPT4 or Claude 3? Also how can perplexity access those models and provide them to its own consumers?
181,Only if you pay for Pro‚Ä¶ why would I pay for something I can get for free?
182,"I didn't say internet, I said Google. If it's using Google how can it replace it ü§°"
183,"You guys are right, Google probably doesn‚Äôt have the resources to figure out how a search engine can both give people the information and support ads. If only they had figured that out in a way that made people still want to use their service previously. Sarcasm aside, do you really think if perplexity came the next search giant that they wouldn‚Äôt incorporate ads?

The reason Google doesn‚Äôt charge for search is because 99% of people won‚Äôt ‚Äúpay‚Äù for it, they‚Äôd rather use the current ad supported model because there‚Äôs a mental component where people think the services (search, ads, email, etc.) are free and will never ‚Äúpay‚Äù for it, they‚Äôd rather give up privacy and look at ads, perplexity cannot scale without switching models and good luck changing the worlds psychology otherwise.

EDIT: Just noticed OPs source is from an AI company, shocker. RemindMe! 3 years to see if Google has lost 50% of their market share"
184,Perplexity uses the APIs of the services to provide them. I have been mainly using Claude 3 Opus mostly as of late. But GPT-4 is solid as well.
185,"Perplexity has its own web crawlers. It has multiple inputs of which Google rankings is one. The less value its rankings have, the less useful it will be and the easier it will be to replace. Perplexity can crawl and index the internet without it as can other search engines. Google is not here forever. That is the nature of tech."
186,Nice analysis of the business model. I think perpexility is benefiting off websites (they regenerate contents from websites and users dont even need to visit websites). Eventually websites wont have enough traffic and may block perplexity or implement firewall.
187,"I have it set up with a quick shortcut (@p, or @pw for writing) but I don't think I'm going to use it as default, that's still DuckDuckGo. If I'm trying to find something very quickly, like a website that I don't know the URL my heart, or how to spell a word, etc. the tiny amount of extra time for perplexity to start outputting can be a little annoying. And when it starts to explain and I'm just waiting for it to finish it's exposition and tell me the answer... default traditional search is better for me. I still use Perplexity for the majority of my searches now though."
188,"I created a custom search in Alfred (Mac app). I type ""plex"" followed by my question. When I hit return the Perplexity website opens and the search begins.

The search URL is [https://www.perplexity.ai/?s=o&q={query}](https://www.perplexity.ai/?s=o&q={query})"
189,Arc added it in the last update.
190,"I just started using it today in a very narrow domain, and the results are jaw-dropping.  Wow, is all I can say."
191,You couldn't do it in Chrome without an extension last time I checked.
192,"I must be getting old, I worry about the carbon footprint of doing this. Perplexity is overkill for most web searches so I wouldn't want to see it as a default. I think the analogy I've heard for this is that using an LLM for web search is like taking a private jet to go to the corner store."

210,"I'm not using Pro either.  For me, the search takes less than a minute and the documentation I found took hours to digest."
211,"I wouldn't assume that. In the early days of a new product getting market share usually takes priority. They may be willing to run inefficiently and at a loss initially. Also, just because a company wants you to use their product, doesn't mean it's the best solution for everything - hence my overkill for most web searches point. 

Regardless, I find myself using perplexity more often than I should. Custom natural language responses are just too damn cool."
212,Mainly for integration with Safari
213,"You are probably right, not abusing it is a good idea."
214,"I use pro. I would say Perplexity (the product, I use GPT4 model) is the only AI capable for research. Bing, Bard, and even CGPT4 with browse can sometimes hallucinate and you have to double check.

The neat thing with perplexity is that most of the time it is accurate and I don't have to search the answer on Google to check again, as what is displayed/answered is already searched deep enough. If there's any information I couldn't get, I just rephrased the question and 90% of the time, I can get the exact answer i want right away.

Been using it for a month to do my thesis, and its really amazing!"
215," I am a pediatric dentist and I use the ‚ÄúAcademic Research‚Äù focus when I am preparing for a seminar or writing a blog for my website. So far so good. However, when writing an article, I found ‚ÄúAll‚Äù focus is good as it creates good subheadings and there are no restrictions on which website Perplexity will dig. In Academic Research, it will search within PubMed, Semanticscholar, nih, and a few more. 

But I don‚Äôt know how perplexity digs a publication even when it is private (because when you click on the source link provided by Perplexiry, the whole paper will not open, there will only be an ‚ÄúAbstract‚Äù)

With Pro, there is one benefit that it searches for more sources. Plus, GPT-4 is good when researching for thesis or seminars, and Claude 2.1 is the best for writing articles for me. And these LLMs are available with Perplexity Pro as the free version uses GPT 3.5.

217,"If you want an AI-assisted research tool, Elicit is probably what you‚Äôre looking for. But keep in mind that Perplexity and Elicit rely on the same digital archives from Semantic Scholar, and those archives aren‚Äôt as comprehensive as Google Scholar or a college library."

240,"Looks fine, but answers are way too short to be comparable to Perplexity, you should use some mistral version instruction tuned on research assistance. Plus you should define a system prompt adequate to the role. I don't know if the perplexity prompt was captured but you should use a good one to get good answers. Also it should have 4096 token windows at least, better 8k.  
Are using some search engine specific API?  
And what scraping tool are you using?"
241,Where's the code?
242,I implemented a simple version of Perplexity's Answer-Search Engine to my CLI tool/project Cha. [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTHk5G6TzH4) is a demo of it working. Cha is open source and you can view the code here: [https://github.com/MehmetMHY/cha](https://github.com/MehmetMHY/cha). I hope this project/code helps with your project.
243,Is the code open sourced?
244,"So far I think its great and I'm just using my phone!! Once I can plug some open source LLMs into it I'll be very happy to kick the tires on this tool.
Good Job dude!!!"

Great question actually! 

It‚Äôs my first launch of any open-source code, so the code quality might be shit but everything will be included with an .env.example and docs.

For scraping, I am using multiple methods and everything will be shared with proper documentation.

1. Local Scrape - works locally and great results 
2. Serverless Scrape - works on Vercel but takes longer and has a 10s timeout limitation 

Lastly HTTP scrape that I just completed. Works the fastest like in 1-3s, less clear results but can scrape any website. No IP blocking or any limitations!

Right now, I am using Serverless functions on Vercel with Pupeteer-core and some other packages on the website and you can see it is slow and might throw a timeout often. Working on fixing that too.

Hope it works excited you for the upcoming launch. Might also do a video to show how everything works if you guys would watch üòÄ




Note: Reddit is by far the worst to scrape any data from. They straight out block any scraping and as of now HTTP scraping is the only working solution."
249,"For me the sources section loaded pretty fast but the answer section did not return anything.

Also had a unsafe website banner before accessing the page.

250,"1) If you make this open source you are a coding god.

2) If you don't, apparently LLM tools make it easy enough to do that someone else will.

3) Please change your banner to say something original. Don't clone perplexity's banner.

Alternative banners? Let's brainstorm. I like:

""Learn anything"""
251,"Perplexity basically runs a google search for every query on a headless chrome, scrapes the content from the top 10-15 blue links and summarizes it."
252,"Looks good, keep going!"
253,ocr and good at multiple languages ... thank you
254,"u/bishalsaha99 This is cool! Have u considered accepting URLs with search querys in the end like `https://www.https://omniplex.vercel.app/search?q=search+query` (which searches the phrase ""search query"" here)? That way I could add it as a custom search engine to a browser like so: `https://www.https://omniplex.vercel.app/search?q=%s` with `%s` being what I type into the URL bar after selecting the search engine.

276,To manage data you can try unstructured io maybe
277,"Ok the issue is totally the web scraping that I am doing. As I said in my other comment, I am using puppeteer-core on Vercel serverless functions that not only has a problem with cold start but also timeouts.

Currently no matter how much I try to but the headless browser is slow and it is easily detected by websites thus getting IP banned. Making the red flag visible. I have contacted Google to remove it but let‚Äôs see.

Good new, I have cracked the scraping part. Not only is faster with plain HTTP scraping but much more efficient all responses coming in 1-3s. No IP bans or restrictions with it. Testing it out as I just completed work on it.

Thanks for the support ‚ù§Ô∏è"
278,"The banner is a troll. So is the initial design. I am a designer though and the side bar is the hardest challenge I have.

4. Profile settings ( Maybe if it works I will make a RAG system for user data only )
5. Experiments ( Custom temperature, penalty and prompt‚Ä¶ )

Everything will be in Firebase and all docs updated. Along with .env.example

As you said someone must do it. After it‚Äôs built and done I hope no one has to make it again and again and devs can start building on top of it.

If you have problem with being flagged as malicious due to the scraping part. You should change approach. Why don't you make the scraping part client-side instead of server side. That would also free the server from a lot of CPU waste. I don't know client side scraping libraries so you should look on your own. Go for lightweight and fast."

Cha took around 1 week (4 weeks of on and off work) but the Answer-Search feature took me one weekend. For scrapping I used Selenium, you can view Cha's scrapper [HERE](https://github.com/MehmetMHY/cha/blob/main/cha/scrapper.py).

299,"What do you mean? You can verify it yourself. Just do a search on perplexity and on google, see the results, it‚Äôs exactly the same 1:1"
300,What do u mean?
301,I see
302,Groq/Llama3
303,"Maybe you should be making http requests to websites on the server side. If you have a server, of course."
304,"Removing the env and fixing the streaming text. Will be up in a week. Really sorry, it a weekend project and I also work in a startup so a bit delay."
305,Hope you all love it.
306,"Yeah, I am actually thinking of making it into a modular form to mix and match llms. But alot of work before I start that.

Any features you would love to have?"
307,"Are you mocking me? If not let me tell you why I wanna build this in open-source.

I f****** hate how Aravind is going around media and Twitter telling people Perplexity will compete with Google. Raising so much money and hype for what? A wrapper? Come on. He thinks his a hero?

Go to show him, he is not the only smart Indian building in AI. Also maybe just maybe if I open-source it and developers love it, we don‚Äôt have to install 100 apps to chat with 100 LLMs?

I am a single guy working on weekends and it is hard but trust me I will get it fixed and share the repo. If I don‚Äôt, here is my website https://bishalsaha.com"
308,I find it to be better in case of tables
309,I will look into it If I can male a figma project for all the components.
310,"Dude. Google doesn‚Äôt provide any APIs for that. Bing does and using Serp APIs is costly and not that useful.

Check the same thing with  Perplexity and Bing results. It‚Äôs same because they use the same API


Also about Headless scraping I tried it myself and you can try it too. It takes at least 10-15s to do 3 websites let alone 15 websites. Perplexity does top 5 websites and I am doing 3 for now."
311,I mean I have my own APIs designed like that. But people can‚Äôt access them without the env and headers so people can‚Äôt abuse the APIs
312,I think it is possible. I‚Äôm also working on this to support multiple LLM architecture. One of the problem statements that I‚Äôm trying to fix is how to optimise for cost and usage?
313,No I have nexts api routes right now. I heard it‚Äôs very common to get blocked and have to do some ip routings to always be ready
314,It‚Äôs also slow to do it in the server side but working on it
315,No problem. Keep the grind up!
316,Somehow if we can integrate it with ollama then we can run the open source models ig. Features like maybe saving my search. Is this functionality present in the current state? I have not tested that
317,"Dude I hate pplx's CEO and his hype inducing activities too. Never got a good feeling from him. But I'm not mocking you. If it's something you do on weekends then fine. But many open source projects get pirated by (unfortunately) mostly Chinese or Indian groups. Go check out Reflex and how it got ripped off by the folks at NextPy. Or how Google and ollama rip the benefits of llama.cpp, making money from it while giving nothing back."
318,"You don‚Äôt need an api to do a google search on a headless browser. All you need is to do a search from the terminal, fetch the urls and run a scraper through the top 5-10 and summarize"
319,Ah I see.
320,"So currently I am hell bent on fixing the web scraping faster and making streaming better. Using Vercel AI SDK, we can change the LLM we want to use. 

I will also provide custom tab to control temperature, prompts, penalties and other variables. 

Hope all this work doesn‚Äôt go to waste. I will soon update you all with the new website and source-code."
321,Check this out https://www.toptal.com/puppeteer/headless-browser-puppeteer-tutorial
322,You can done but it‚Äôs just not fast enough nor useful to run the headless browser so much. Try it and see the lag.
323,"Yah controlling the parameters like top k, p, max tokens is something i'd love to tinker with. I'm always trying out things in python and wanted to build websites on top(but couldn't as I'm noob in web dev) so I was happy seeing such an open source project similar to perplexity"
324,"In my impression, there was a time when ChatGPT spending more time and search more thoroughly, and giving a more comprehensive result, that version is really helpful. Now it is just lazy as shit.

Considering the project can be deployed locally, if you can get the user data only RAG system in plan to work, personally I don't need it to work so fast. I am perfectly ok if it takes an hour but produces a long manuscript where all the sources are marked. Plz consider offer different speed options\~

Just providing a user's view, rooting for your awesome work!"
325,Obviously they are not doing it at search time. They probably have the indexes pre fetched and all they do is summarize
326,RAGs with personal data in really low on priority right now but yep I have though about that.
327,"I don‚Äôt think they do have their own index. If they had why does it match exactly to Bing and if they had their own index it‚Äôs just too expensive even for them.

See I built the prototype and I can see same speed and answers so I don‚Äôt get it why you are trying to say."
328,I am not trying to prove a point. Obviously I appreciate your efforts here. Just offering what I have observed with perplexity. Also check out this video from 12:46 https://youtu.be/7iU6K7NccXk?si=vPIasrDcwTIZdF8H
329,"Hey man, I didn‚Äôt say it in a mean way. I appreciate your curiosity and thoughts. 

Thanks for sharing the info also. Let‚Äôs see where I can take it into."
330,"No problem, I would love to contribute to this project to. If you are open sourcing it, do share the repo."
331,"What are the legal frameworks around scraping the indexed websites, for example perplexity gives info on people from LinkedIn if you search. 

Ld itself disallows scraping and so do other websites, how is perplexity even continuing this? 

Any clue ?"
332,Give me some time. With in this week for sure.
333,It gave only 3 sources and just one inline citation. It looks promising though
334,good job OP! looking forward to the launch.
335,"The source code is private and it uses proprietary APIs. What part is open source?
I'm assuming you plan to release it after some testing and give it compatibility with stuff like llama.cpp?"
336,Would you provide an API?
337,GitHub link?
338,Great work! When will this be made open-source?
339,"Hey, this is a fantastic project which I'm very keen on. 

I finally got around to using perplexity earlier to do some fact checking.

https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Firstly-the-Lancaster-1CxVXKR4Te.6Xiu95_4Cew

Then I came across you're project and decided to give it a go to see how it compares. First time I ran it I got a fair few hallucinations, looks like whatever model ur using can get easily distracted by irrelevant sites. I'd suggest a better way of filtering context or a beefier model. 

After making an accouunt, the second time I ran the same questions, I noticed the answers didn't seem to have as many hallucinations but the sources returned are still not great.
https://imgur.com/a/MZJNj2e

Still this is extremely promising given that its just your efforts over a few weeks, I'm sure once others get onboard once its open source it'll be competing with perplexity. 

Let me know if theres anything I can do to help in the meantime."
340,"Granted I was doing searches related to incredibly esoteric star wars mobile game questions, but yours gave better answers than perplexity for me. Maybe more depth with less sources? I'm super intrigued. Well done!"
341,"https://preview.redd.it/eak0vqplq3vc1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=257a2ba11d5ed9580b19d0aa0e30c2a7132a0ad1

Got this error, can‚Äôt get past it."
342,This is awesome! How are you getting the sources/references? Is there a GitHub link?
343,impressive
344,"Good job! Really good website!

Something I found is that I only get to the login page by clicking on ""Attach"". Is it possible to add a login button somewhere, maybe in the menu?

And also, sometimes when the model tries to give a long answer, it gets cut off by the token length. Can it be informed by a system prompt before answering that it should keep the answer to a specific length?

Thank you for your incredible work!"
345,What's the tech stack?¬†
346,looks great :)
347,"It's definitely interesting.  I tested it out with some silly questions about me found on Google like ""who is paradise Rodriguez-Bordeaux?"", "" does she like garlic bread?"" ""She she mean or nice?"" And ""what school does she go to?"" Which I had to swap out for ""attend"" and it still didn't get it correct. 

I did like how it doesn't give a crap load of fluff.  

What are your goals with it? It could be something I wouldn't mind supporting."
348,Good job man hope you will rival perplexity I'll believe in ya. Just improve the ui and maybe it will look more shiny and actually new. But keep up!
349,Using just 3 sources as to increase the depth. Perplexity takes 600 tokens from each website while I am taking in 5000 tokens.
350,Thanks man.
351,"Will open-source even the APIs. Don‚Äôt worry man, I am just fixing the bugs.

No plans to use local models but working on adding multiple LLM architecture.

Just a request, when launch please üôè pay a subscription or the least star the project. Lost my job and this is the only way I can pay my bills.

The subscription will be $10-20 max and have all the GPT models ready"
352,No. Why would you need an API?
353,Still in development
354,"After the beta testing, I will launch directly"
355,"Another thing, you can share the url and don‚Äôt need to upload images. I have build a share and fork feature"
356,"Thanks for the feedback. I don‚Äôt know what to tell, the interest in beta test itself is very low and people don‚Äôt seem to care.

Just getting demotivated"
357,:)
358,Can you try to create a new chat?
359,Still working
360,Thanks
361,"First, just click on the sidebar menu and click on the bottom profile.

Second, you can change the max length from settings.

In beta it‚Äôs completely free and you can easily change the settings by just click subscribe.

Hope you love it üòª"
362,"Next Js, Vercel, OpenAI and Bing"
363,Feedback
364,The real idea was to mock them
365,"Oh I see, that‚Äôs very different then, it may be better"
366,I‚Äôm building an app which needs perplexity type responses for one feature
367,so not open source.... But maybe some day you will open source it?
368,"Sweet, is that live yet?

https://imgur.com/a/hIUPDGu

I don't seem to be able to see it."
369,Could you give a high level explanation of how you're able to cite sources? Are you querying through Bing and then passing that to the LLM?
370,I absolutely do! Thanks! Do you have some sort of Discord page for beta testers to give more feedback? I'll gladly help!
371,"How have you found Bing v OpenAI, are prompts understood 1:1?"
372,"Sure:   
  
1) the upload button suggests that you can ""attach"" any files, however only images are supported. PDF would be especially helpful but text files and other documents as well. In the meantime maybe change the logo to an image so its less confusing of which files you can upload.

2) The upload button disappears after the first message, so if you want to upload something after the first prompt you have to start a new chat which may not always be ideal. 

3) Long prompts including code or docker settings (which I tested) just hang and dont produce any response. 

Otherwise its really good and I personally prefer the design compared to the llm-answer-engine which I also tested (https://github.com/developersdigest/llm-answer-engine) which also currently does not support any file uploads as far as I know. 

Great project, thank you :)"
373,Huh weird reason but oh well
374,For now you can just click subscribe and use. No payments in beta so feel free to test the settings and provide feedback.
375,"Just use Bing, SERP or anything else. There is no API to help you with exactly what you need."
376,Just after this beta testing. Trying to fix some bugs before launch. And I found a lot of bugs üêû
377,Just share the link here. The link of the chat
378,Example - https://omniplex.vercel.app/chat/AKmOr7Q7tD
379,"Yep, nothing fancy here."
380,https://discord.gg/ENUaxT5tRT
381,What
382,Bro prompted a human being üíÄ
383,"1. Don't know which images/files are supported and not.  
2. It's expensive from a bootstrap point right now but I will fix it.  
3. Did you try writing mode for just coding?"
384,"Look, I started this project because I thought Perplexity was being to much shady by talking about competing with Google and all.

I mean if you are trying to compete with Google how am I able to create the same product?"
385,Ok thanks
386,Perplexity provides an API
387,"That is the fun of opensource, we all find and help fix bugs. TBH it looks like this will be a paid service and not open sourced based on your other comments"
388,Ahh ok that's easier than I thought - https://omniplex.vercel.app/chat/sCoDGjx66C
389,That's awesome! It would be awesome if you could open source this part (or if you have a reference implementation). I'm not very familiar with this part of things
390,"I was assuming you were using both Bing API and Open AI API, for prompt responses, curious if they return identical data, especially same JSON"
391,"Wild

![gif](giphy|XteNIxbCLj3HzEfAil)"
392,Yep I agree with you. How are they gonna compete with Google thats already become too iconic? (Ex. Lego batman cameo) yeah they might fail.
393,You don‚Äôt get any website links from that. That is just a fine-tuned llama and mistral AI that they host. Pretty useless in my opinion.
394,It will be open-source but I hope people will pay for me to keep working on it
395,"Best part is, I can fork your chat and continue without effecting your chat."
396,It‚Äôs a mix of search-scrape-prompts
397,"No, Bing returns only the search results."
398,What
399,They are providing citations in beta to few users
400,"github has sponsors, I sponsor a few projects and contribute where I can. Just saying you are posting all over reddit calling it open source yet it is not."
401,"So thats what you mean by fork haha .. That's a really nice feature, makes collaboration that much easier. 

Thinking outloud here but would also be cool to have a merge feature for teams/groups of people forking each others chat. That way you can preserve the most interesting threads and also explore other avenues without worrying about polluting that ""main"" chat."
402,I'm too lazy to redo what I said just use chatgpt to explain what said if you're confused with what I said
403,"I said it will be. Let me complete the code. Did I make anyone pay or anything?

All I am trying to do is gather feedback. Rather than taking donations I am trying to ask people are they willing to pay a subscription if they can get the same value as Perplexity or ChatGPT.

This will help me to continue working and build more."
404,If I get enough paid users only then. I really have start using redix for faster loading time and more compute.
405,"https://preview.redd.it/xpp5xbo1dbvc1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=dda01f84e800a9fba67e2c5b52f3bfe869173290

Also working on link previews so people know what they are clicking on"
406,Still didn‚Äôt get it but thanks üôè
407,so not open source... But maybe some day it will be. Got it
408,Doesn't work now due to latency.
409,Hey op I just tested your app again and I suggest setting the customs instruction the be free like chatgpt if it doesn't cost you more money.
410,"Dude, just let me complete it. By next week promise I will post the GitHub link here"
411,"It does when someone changes the model. For now it‚Äôs free, just click the subscribe button and use it.

Also all data will be deleted after the beta trials"
412,any news? I see you are working on the money part before you just upload it to github
413,"I mean I have to, join my discord we take there a lot around the code https://discord.gg/DvBgZ9yemt"
414,https://github.com/Omniplex-ai/omniplex star this for now
415,there is nothing there....
416,"Check now, updated"
417,"I just tried it again and I am not feeling it. It seems like it tries to do away with links and only provide answers, but I kind of find that useless. 

The way I use a search engine is I query it for a bunch of keywords and then I look through the links to try and find something that provides me with information I didn't have before.

So perplexity trying to just provide an answer doesn't really work for me, because I rarely actually ask a specific question. I just want it give me links matching my keywords so I can read those. In fact just getting one answer feels super limiting to me, most of the time it just tells me what I already know, what I am looking for is what I _don't_ know."
418,I use Perplexity next to Bard and ChatGPT3.5 regularly for random questions I have. I don't think it is a case of which is superior; they are different and can give alternate perspectives on subjects.
419,The good news is that when these AI companies fail in a year or 5. There will be a glut of cheap GPUs on the market.
420,[deleted]
421,"Accurately regurgitating correct info is one of the things current AI is super bad at. Unfortunately, one of the things it‚Äôs great at is wording thing sun believable way."
422,I've tried it alongside Bing and generally got better results from Bing.
423,This bubble is going to pop so hard
424,"Let me get this straight.
A startup with no product, no users, no path to profitability, is valued at 520 million?

Talk about money laundering..."
425,Bubble Factory
426,Seems heavily overvalued. Won't be surprised if this shits down in a couple of years.
427,"Search engines need to show their work. Which is what links are. When a search engine just provides answers, that‚Äôs an assistant."
428,"I love perplexity! I have been using it as an alternative to a search engine, and it is simply incredible. Highly recommended!"
429,Interesting ...
430,Not bad for something no-one has heard about. Good luck displacing Google. Definitely nothing I would invest in.
431,"Yup, its all hot air. They will say tech is maturing. But they will do this to appease.VCs. And VCs are suckers for tech.

You will see a lot of this in the year ahead. Any startup that cannot demonstrate they use AI in some shape or form AND doesn't have .ai domain name, won't get any funding."
432,"This is *exactly* why I‚Äôm frustrated with Google lately. If I do a perfectly reasonable keyword search, I get all sorts of unrelated crap‚Äîespecially commercial stuff; it doesn‚Äôt matter whether it‚Äôs sophisticated SEO or Google promoting its advertising clients: I‚Äôm getting crap I *don‚Äôt want*. If I happen to experimentally type in a natural-language question with a straightforward factual answer, though, suddenly it‚Äôs *magic* and pulls up a direct answer. It‚Äôs clear that they‚Äôre *optimizing* for that style of use.

The problem here is that the *interaction model* here is different. The old Google Search was a *tool* that I could use; the new one is an *oracle* that tells me what *it* thinks I need. At heart, Google has *taken away user control*, and that should be recognized for exactly what it is: enshittification.

With the new year, I‚Äôve set my browser to use DuckDuckGo by default. It‚Äôs not as good as Google Search used to be ‚Ä¶ but neither is Google Search."
433,Yeah also will you trust everything that comes from an AI ? At least with a link I can somehow know if it‚Äôs right or wrong.
434,"What's the long term business model where anyway? Capture all the search traffic in a golden AI box and never push traffic to various pages?

Eventually this will just ebb up being Google with more steps and maybe a nicer summary feature."
435,"I still find it extremely useful for precise questions. 

For example: can you rank the Toyota RAV4,  Mazda CX-5, Honda CRV, and Subaru Forester by rear legroom? It puts out a table with the answers. 

Saves a bunch of time. I view it as ChatGPT with up-to-date/more recent training set."
436,"Agreed. 

Google has had the ‚Äúim feeling lucky‚Äù option for 20 years."
437,"> it tries to do away with links and only provide answers, but I kind of find that useless.

Yeah, providing information instead of pushing you towards the ad-filled unusable cancer that is most websites on the internet these days really is 'useless', right? /s"
438,"You hit the nail on the head. This is one of the biggest things I think Google has had to contend with as they tried to soak up more ad revenue, year after year.

Not every search has a simple and clean answer. 

If I look up the word ""sailing"", I just want to see what I might discover that I totally don't know about sailing.

It's like picking a book off a bookshelf in a section of a library that interests you, but having no clue what's in the book. Not knowing what you'll find is basically the fun part.

Trying to ""answer"" everything takes all the fun out of it. I don't ever want to build something that does that into my own search engine, cause it would kinda just suck. Though I do think pure answer engines have their place for more mundane things like conversions and whatnot."
439,[deleted]
440,"I don't know what happened to chatgpt, but it became dumb. It regularly gives me wrong answers. But Copilot, which is also chatgpt, is useful."
441,"I'm a big fan of ChatGPT4, it gives what seems to be real accurate info and cites sources really well"
442,Scalpers: hello there.
443,They will be obsolete in 5 years
444,But can an H100 run Crysis?
445,"You are talking about two different sets of people as if they are the same. Venture capital firms fund startups. Venture capital firms are not  the people cutting thousands of jobs. As someone else noted, startups get funding because sometimes they make it big, leading to big payouts for investors"
446,"Well they know most of them will fail. But one that will succeed will cover all other losses. If you have shit tons of money and hire people that know shit to invest for you, chances are you can make a lot of money. More importantly they usually pump it so much to push the shares into the market with prices. So they always win."
447,"I don't know, maybe I just have a bad luck, but I don't think that Bing AI had ever showed me what I was looking for. It's always some off-topic nonsense. I use it from time to time to check it, but it's always the same."
448,"I gave it a try recently, and I must be either blind to its greatness, or it's not that useful.

It's not giving me an edge in web search. I found most of my stuff more easily with Google Keywords or ChatGPT Plus searching the web than with Perplexity AI."
449,Well they've raised millions and Amazon's founder Jeff Bezos invested too. So did NVIDIA
450,They've gotten so many Linux servers also from AWS for instance.
451,"> And VCs are suckers for tech.

No, they're suckers for buzz words."
452,"I agree about the oracle thing, that is kind of what these products try to be. And I am more looking for a librarian."
453,Computer identification and classification algorithms have almost caused a full blown (throw everything you got!) From the Soviet Union what now seems like hundreds of years ago.  The Russian in command decided not to escalate the issue to his upper echelon and told everyone to ignore it.  For that he was punished and then awarded and then punished again.
454,"Well, they have a lot of work left to do then, because it will only become useful to me once it tells me things that are new information, and by definition I don't really know what these things are before I see them.

Meaning even if it did go through those links and give me a condensed version of what I would find when I clicked the links, I'd still might end up in a situation where would just like to take a look myself. Cause once it told me what _it_ thinks is the relevant information, then the only other way for me to find out anything new is to click the links and read for myself.

Also kind of doubt we will not have some kind of thing that can be used to precisely point at something (as in with a mouse). Maybe something other then a piece of plastic that we slide around on the table, it might just be our fingers, but I'd assume it would be something that is precise and easy to use. There would be very little room for the finger pointing recognition ~~algorithm~~ AI to go wrong and pick the wrong thing before it becomes frustrating and I want my mouse back."
455,same for me. on the other hand I am liking answers by bard more and more. specifically when I am searching about recent topics. bard is more knowledgeable
456,"I feel like I've noticed this with other AI tools as well, they work at the beginning but over time some of them seem to teach themselves the wrong information and progressively get worse."
457,5 years ago the 2080 Super released. Honestly still a viable card these days.
458,"Yup and those VCs would never invest more money into established companies, especially not for them to retain employees, because they are looking for much higher returns than are possible with such safe investments."
459,You would think investors would know better
460,"Well ya‚Ä¶ the tech was introduced to mass consumption 9 months ago. Give it some time.

In regard to your second point about always needing something to ‚Äúpoint‚Äù. Consider that computers existed for close to 50 years before the mouse was invented. The interaction method before windows was a command line, of course folks before the invention of the mouse thought some form of the command line was always going to be required, now most folks don‚Äôt even know what a command line is."
461,I asked bard what the mechanism in our neurons is in multiple ways and all it would do is show a meaningless graph. I called it the lowercase r word and about a week later I tried again. It gave a much more detailed answer.
462,"Oh no, so copilot might get worse after learning from my awful code?"
463,They should but being technically literate is not a requirement for investing into technology companies.
464,"They're not interested whether the tech works or not, or whether the company has a future or not. They're interested in selling their stock for more than they bought it for. Hype is incredibly useful for this."
465,"They‚Äôre not investing, they‚Äôre playing the lottery. Many of these startups just get eaten by google and shut down."
466,"Sure, I mean I am actually cautiously optimistic about this stuff, I am saying this particular example of what the perplexity guys are doing there is just not working for me currently, but I do think that maybe something could be changed there to make it useful.

I do have a feeling that a lot of the assumptions these startups make are that they can basicly make something that takes over the thinking for me, and then that would be a successful product, but that seems like a non-sensical idea to me. 

I want to do the thinking, the machine is free to help me though, and if it can actually improve my problem solving approach then I'd be very likely to use it.

EDIT: Command line interfaces are still alive and kicking though, at least in the world of software engineering. In fact I feel like with chatgpt et al we're coming full circle back to command line interfaces, but this time mass market compatible. Also one thing not being used anymore doesn't mean any other thing is going to not be used anymore eventually."
467,"The warren buffet type of investors don't need to know the technology, they need to read people and markets and those skills should make you immune to falling for buzzwords."
468,"Right, it‚Äôs just another tool, albeit a very powerful (perhaps the most powerful we have created) one at that.

The tool will take some time to refine and shape in a way that is useful to us, and it will continue to reshape as society does.

That‚Äôs what I find so incredible about the tech, it‚Äôs ability to adapt and fit to different problems mirrors that of our own innate ability. I think the two in tandem will be game changing. But we are literally on page 2 right now."
469,Being technically literate would give them the knowledge to not fall for modern day snake oil through.
470,"EDIT: In response to your edit. This is true, many professionals still use the command line or similar interface, though I think the true power of AI tech will be bringing that level of productivity without the specialized knowledge required to operate to the masses.

You‚Äôre right the tech will exist in one form or another, but I suspect our society will largely shift to more convenient methods of interfacing with computers (and methods that support much higher bandwidth)"
471,I've been using it religiously.
472,When is copilot and other features that are on the website coming to mobile? I really hope this program doesn‚Äôt get greedy like everything nowadays.

477,"I thought I was conducting research on ""2D materials"" with perplexity.ai and it sabotages the Perplexity.ai method of inquiry. It stops searching the web, searches only the transcripts, and when asked again to return to searching the web, it gives me a false reply purportedly from OpenAI's ChatGPT4 that states ""my cutoff date is September 2021"" when OpenAI themselves published their new cutoff date being ""April 2023.""
I have a Pro subscription. Why couldn't I search the web with an alternative generative ai at Perplexity.ai?
There's no way to perform a conversation turn for real research.

I have to keep reminding it to refer to the original query.
The transcript method is too unrealistic to do research that involves realistic conversation turns that depend on transfer learning in between turns.

re ""Why would you need to reinvent the wheel."":

first, it is a legal problem - it violates google TOS to ""use"" google ranking; that being said, perplexity could just pay bing, brave APIs to serve its users with commercial license, but it chose to ""use"" google, which does not have any whole web APIs.

second, google could cut you off easily and it is basically not a sustainable business (and i am surprised a company that raised at 1B still scrapes google for every query);

third, if the value is just last-mile wrapper with a nice UI (which in hindsight it is more a feature than a product), while google is doing all the heavy lifting for perplexity (and perplexity is badmouthing google for attentions constantly), does perplexity really deserve its claimed brand as google killer? As a user, i think it is a fraud..


Anyway, the point of this post is NOT whether perplexity need to build index or not, like i mention there is many commercial APIs that perplexity could buy, but really about It is a *wrapper* of the very product it‚Äôs claiming to compete with, and continually to badmouth on. very bad karma"

598,And presenting them in messy UI. Never found it useful. Bezos invested in it which is why techies and geeks have taken to it.
599,"So it's a grift, good to know."
600,This is my concern with these AI companies some of them are clearly built on OpenAIs backbone touting a unique LLM. If OpenAI makes a move that puts a bad taste in user's mouth that will topple a large majority of the market.
601,Perplexity has multiple custom trained models.
602,And yet it's better than using google search or bard most of the time.

604,"So true. Most of the time we don't want search results. We want an answer.

For navigational queries, on the other hand -- ""take me to IMDB for movie X"" -- Google still works ok, but that's just a glorified address bar."
605,google does not have official api for whole web search that is same as its production.
606,"How many of you actually switched to perplexity? I did a 7 day experiment and every time I wanted to search I tried both Google and perplexity and majority of times I found Google experience better. Eg, I wanted to find out which gym I should go to I'd much rather read the original review from Google than going through a synthesized answer which I didn't know if I can trust."
607,Yea except it can't do simple things like locate the nearest metro station to a certain intersection. Gave up and did it manually because it kept hallucinating.¬†
608,You pumping a site you own or contribute to?
609,"It is really debatable whether it is better, I think there is a lot of hype in it that people fight on social media on a productivity tool, which in the hindsight is a bit perplexed and not sure if it is really organic. But yeah the point is more about copying than product experience"
610,"How is this not stealing someone‚Äôs work? It‚Äôs stealing Google‚Äôs considerable work on its index, and then still stealing the work of the content producers by summarizing their content while bypassing any monetization of their site‚Äîand it‚Äôs still an LLM trained on countless people‚Äôs writing. It‚Äôs hard to imagine it stealing more people‚Äôs work."
611,The snake that eats its own tail
612,"I mean it could just use Bing.

Though I‚Äôd argue the ‚Äúgoogle killer‚Äù is just a general LLM once it is good enough to answer accurately (and it would have to update in real time). At least for the information-retrieval function that is google search.

As it is google and LLMs will both be around for a long time but as LLMs get better I do suspect they will capture more of google‚Äôs traffic."
613,"So your point is about them lying about using an in-house index, though you also admit that it really doesn‚Äôt matter if they do or not.

Fair enough then, it‚Äôs generally bad to lie."
614,"Theres value in having a app with that many users tho, you learn alot about how to optimize queries for latency, running llms at scale, etc. Not to mention its gathered billions of user queries by now.

There may be a lawsuit from google later, but they'll probably have made way more money then whatever fine they get.   


And didn't google get sued by oracle for the same schtick back in early 2000s. Its come full circle now"
615,Google has also a commercial API for its search engine so I don't think it's against their TOS to use their ranking: [https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview)
616,You have Google SGE? It does this
617,The irony of this response is üßë‚Äçüç≥üíã
618,"This was my experience as well. For direct answers, I use chatgpt directly. Google and chatgpt app is still the best. SGE is getting really good. This company will be toast in a year!! And so are many"
619,Have you tried using the pro version or just the free version? The pro version is way better.
620,"IMO they should make a really great and robust search capability capable of answering questions like these

Then OpenAI should acquire it - saving the time and resources needed to develop their own version - and using their algorithm within Gpt-4. Major synergies for them through the complementary functions, takes out some competition, and its good for users in saving them having to pay for two services, or benefiting from the functionality of both for those who will only pay for one."
621,lol I wish
622,"I don't remember Perplexity claiming they don't scrape / copy / use / Google search results.  
I also don't really think it's ""really debatable"" which experience is DEFINITELY better. Perplexity is so much better that I prefer to shell out $30/month to them rather have Google do it for FREE. The experience of ""Googling"" or finding things out, is vastly vastly different in Google vs Perplexity for me. That doesn't mean Perplexity has a special moat, it just means Google search is a horrible mess of ads and SEO crap that was created by Google itself, and Perplexity is offering a solution to that."
623,If google is allowed to show the essence of an article without users having to click on that site I think others should be allowed to just scrape the google result. Ideally everyone is paid for their work but why draw the line for an index and not allow LLMs to use that material? This is about someone copying a copy.
624,"maybe i am an outlier, but in a survey in my friends circle, who are all very tech savvy so they all know perplexity, no one really used perplexity ai heavily for their daily search, not to say replace search.. it is just less efficient and you anyway need to check the citations manually to make sure it is right"
625,"Yes but the value is really marginal here, comparing to Google and ChatGPT that it relies on"
626,"this API returns very different results than production, if you try a few queries to verify. overall, this is for people to use to search a few website, the whole web ranking never comes close to the google production. so, given how perplexity's results are similar to google production, it is not possible that they are using this API."
627,"Yes I‚Äôve had access to Google SGE for a while through beta. Perplexity is undoubtedly better, especially the pro search feature that is actually able to ask me clarifying questions about what I‚Äôm specifically looking for."
628,"Lol every now and then I see xx should acquire perplexity, why would a loyal user care about this? I am perplexed"
629,"many of you points are just similar and already discussed in other threads, so check the discussion of the top voted comments for answers there. Not going to repeat again"
630,I got the impression that they weren‚Äôt summarizing Google‚Äôs limited previews but the actual pages.
631,I use it for searching images and the results are great. I haven't experienced the SERP part yet but I'd be surprised to be awful compared to direct searches on Google.
632,"SGE has always let you ask follow up questions for free. 

I just asked both ""how often should I water a tomato plant"" and I almost undoubtedly thought SGE was better. It addressed different potting situations and how to check how moist the soil is, while giving the same recommended 1-2 inches that perplexity said"
633,">Then OpenAI should acquire it - saving the time and resources needed to develop their own version - and using their algorithm within Gpt-4. Major synergies for them through the complementary functions, takes out some competition, and its good for users in saving them having to pay for two services, or benefiting from the functionality of both for those who will only pay for one."
634,"If you're not gonna repeat again, then shut it. You either reply or you don't."
635,No I don‚Äôt think you realize what I‚Äôm saying. I‚Äôm not talking about the interface asking the HUMAN to ask a follow up question. I‚Äôm saying that perplexity allows the AI to ask YOU a clarifying question to help it better understand what you‚Äôre looking for.
636,"Well the issue is that there is nothing that OpenAI does not have that perplexity ai has, given perplexity‚Äôs dependency on ChatGPT and Google. Due to their focus on growth, the expertise they developed on top of those dependency is very marginal. Ppl often quote on the speed of perplexity ai, if you check out the other comment which links to the explanation of how to achieve the speed, you will see it is not technically hard to do it. So it really comes down if the company has important tech asset to buyer, for OpenAI, it is not a good fit, but could be some other less AI savvy companies. However, as they raised more money, it will be harder for buyers to buy it. Both fewer financially qualified buyers and FTC will kick in to block the deal."
637,"Oh about their version, OpenAI already had search, I believe they updated it quietly a few weeks ago, now there is no wait time for search to see the first token"
638,"Probably they're not from Meta. Huggingface has these already:

639,"Either llama 3 gets very confused and forgetful after a few prompts or the perplexity implementation is poor. It seems to quickly forget what was in its own context and just complains that it can't find the information which is blatantly there just a few paragraphs up. When you point this out, it just says that it doesn't have access to previous conversations.
    
Verdict. Next to useless."
640,I'm assuming small is 8B and large is 70b please correct me if I'm wrong?
641,isn't context extension normally done post-traning? like using llama3 base (non-instruct) and fine-tunning with longer contexts?
642,These self increased context lengths in huggingface are probably what‚Äôs at perplexity. They‚Äôre next to useless above 8K anyways‚Ä¶
643,Hopefully they release their fine tunes.
644,Bro charge your phone XD
645,Thanks but it would seem none of these actually work past 8K well. Edit: apparently they can go some ways with rope scaling.
646,These are not the ones fined tuned by Perplexity.
647,That‚Äôs just perplexity. Not useful.¬†
648,"It looks like LLama 3 is high-tech. You can't just go ahead and improve high-tech. You can't just take and improve a modern car or computer. And in the same way, you can't ""improve"" a neural network that has actually been trained well.

Numerous ‚Äúimprovements‚Äù to a truly technologically advanced product actually just break it.

And the numerous ‚Äúfinetunes‚Äù of Llama 3 - from Dolphin to this example - only prove this."
649,"Yes, and when you see medium, it has been 8x7b before."
650,Somehow I'm not surprised.  Mistral with 32k native in theory doesn't work well past 5-8k. Taking a model which was launched with 8k and extending it is tricky.
651,No issues with rope scaling but I've only gone up to about 24k before ooming.
652,It would seem?  Did you try them?  Folks have been sharing their experiments on Twitter and else where and going hard to sort these out.  At least back up your comment with data.
653,Iirc LLAMA-3-8's needle in a haystack test has flawless 32K context
654,"How exactly should rope scaling be used in addition to these models? Let's say I'm using the 8B-Instruct-64k file, would I then pass the ""--**rope**-scale 4"" parameter to llama.cpp/main, or is that scaling twice? As of now, I get gibberish with \~40k context length with or without rope scaling."
655,"So far, my initial tests are that Llama 3 is far worse at following complex prompts than the scores it's getting on the leaderboards would suggest.  It's not even keeping pace with the best of the older 7B's. I keep checking to see whether it's something I need to adjust in prompt formatting, but haven't been able to figure it out if that's the case."
656,"I tested on the original 8B (8K) model extend to 16K and work surprisingly well (I also try 32K and still work, but due to my limit memory, it became very slow). LLama 3 is actually the only local models that I tried (only have 12G VRAM) can go over 10K without becoming gibberish."
657,"If you are using a LlamaCPP backend, that might explain the poor quality.  Apparently there are tokenizer issues, that will be rectified with some updates and freshly baked GGUFs."
658,"maybe you can try dolphin version with chatML format.. i am planning to, some day"
659,"I just tested it again.  It's doing well in LM studio with my 'realism' prompt and my 'fly' and 'jump' tests, so that's good.  The prompts it still struggles with there I've been having trouble getting most models to consistently follow lately. Hopefully Koboldcpp will get things sorted out."
660,is that the stopping issue or something else?
661,"EDIT:  Sorry, got your reply confused with a different topic.

I think it just has to do with quality in general, such as the model just keeps talking or missing aspects of a conversation.  LM3-70b was kinda dumb compared to CommandR+, and I don't mean in terms of the parameter gulf.  Something was...off.  LM2-70b finetunes were better at picking up subtle cues."
662,"Perplexity is still the best imo. Allows reading documents, create collections (that work kinda like custom gpts), great interface, allows focus and specific searches, allows you to choose the model you want to use.. It's a much worthy subscription, given it's the same price."
663,[deleted]
664,"Gemini Ultra (Advanced) is a piece of trash. Its reasoning is far behind ChatGPT 4. You shouldn't even compare them. So, if you have an option of ChatGPT 4 or Claude 2, use the instead. Anyway, you can try Gemini Advanced by yourself, it has a 2 months trial."
665,"i got gemini ultra yesterday with those 2 months for free and so far its a big disappointment. outside of us nothing except the actual language model even runs. not even the app. so i checked its responses with all the models in perplexity and it was so full of filters and blockers, chatgpt feels like uncesored compared to it. even gemini pro gives better responses for those cases. so all in all, i prefer chatgpt over this for factual stuff within perplexity, but interestingly, for opinions about movies gemini ultra seems pretty unbiased compared to gpt4. image recognition is full of filters and barely works. like wanted to let it create a funny comment on a holiday image of a friend and it refused to do it, becasue there are people on the image.

so all in all, id say it really depends on your location and usecase, but i wouldnt recommend it in its actual state now."
666,"Gemini is great for searching through your inbox and gdrive. Not for anything else, basically."
667,Gemini is absolute and utter shit. It lies every time I ask it questions and does not want to provide sources. It‚Äôs a rival to no one.
668,There will be a more significant uptick in Copilot usage after their Super Bowl ad airs.
669,"Gemini is one of the most censored model out there. I just can't have stupid fun with it.
I never used pplx to have have fun tbh, but it's so fast and ui is so neat, I don't want to."
670,"Perplexity for search, ChatGPT Plus for in-depth creative work, coding assistance, etc."
671,"At this point it is almost literally the flavor of the week. The models get updated and renewed constantly, and new models pop up daily. Granted, most are not on par with the large players but some get really close. 

For me a good answer would require to first look at the intention for choosing a model, if you require a stable, daily use model, just go with any of the big players (perplexity of course, in this subreddit) and stick with it. If they are behind today, they will probably catch up next week. 

If you are looking for the absolute best today, and willing to look again tomorrow, probably out of some academic curiosity or otherwise, go for it. I think today Gemini ultra might be the best allrounder, but I also think whether it is or not is not very important for most users as long as it is good enough."
672,I just used both and chose perplexity one tap perplexity the other gemini.  If you also want to test heres a disocunt for 50% off ZF186MIQ in perplexity.
673,I checked today and they removed Gemini from the options. It's now back to just GPT 4 and Claude 2.1
674,you are not wrong. lol
675,yep just tried it. Same with your statement it's piece of trash. Instantly regretüòÇ
676,Agree
677,yup gemini advanced is so overrated.
678,so a glorified search bar lol
679,"what are examples of ""things that totally failed"" for you?"
680,"Basically. It can go above that in organizing your data nicely, like asking it for a list of invoices in your inbox with specific information extracted. Of course, there's a good chance it's hallucinating, so you do have to double-check, but it can make it a lot easier to find a specific invoice, compared to using a keyword-based search and then clicking on each email to see if it's the right one or not."
681,"I uploaded an image of a person but it said ""I can't describe a person YET"" ohh my gpt4 can but why can't you??"
682,"Did you actually try this? It can't even go through my labeled ""tax relevant"" receipts and give me a summary."
683,"I did it in the days before Gemini with Bard. If it no longer works, that‚Äôs a massive fail from Google"
684,"Maybe I'm too stupid to prompt it correctly. It gives me like one or two correct mails, the rest is garbage."
685,"They seem to be going down the github for ML models path more than anything else.  I suspect the more advanced features like automated benchmarking, model versioning, CI/CD for for data, models and pipelines, is where they're gonna go."
686,"The shovels, not the gold"
687,"If they developed a foundation model that directly competes with the closed models, they risk antagonizing model developers who post models on their platform.

On the other hand, they have been safely testing the water by releasing datasets and finetuned models.

Zephyr 7B was one lf the best 7B models when it released."
688,"So I think it's somewhat well known that before they became the GitHub for models, their original plan was to build a chatbot-digital friend. I wonder if that has baggage now that the world has pivoted back to chatbot applications."
689,"Hey all! I'm HF Chief Llama Officer. ü§ó This is a frequent question for sure, so I wanted to put some time explaining this.

Hugging Face core goal is to enable collaborative Machine Learning. How do we do this?

* Provide a platform where the community can share and collaborate in models and datasets, as well as discuss about papers and stay up to date with the latest in ML.
* Implement OS tools that allow people to easily use datasets and pre-trained models, including transformers, diffusers, datasets, PEFT, trl, and so on.
* Collaborate very closely with researchers, from anime-looking Discord servers to multi-billion research labs, helping make their open-access releases as impactful and accessible as possible. For example, we worked with Tim Dettmers for [QLoRA](https://huggingface.co/blog/4bit-transformers-bitsandbytes), with the KTO authors to integrate into trl, and so on.
* Build and maintain tools that allow people to easily run models on-device, such as optimum and transformers.js.
* And we provide tools to easily use models in production, such as TGI for LLM deployment, but also integrations with AWS/Google Cloud/etc.
* Have the [Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) platform that enables researchers and practitioners to build ML demos and showcase their work to a much wider audience. This includes [hugging/chat](https://huggingface.co/chat/), where people can try out different open-access models (and the UI is open-source too!)
* Craft free [content](https://huggingface.co/learn) to help people get into ML and their areas of interest!
* We host some dozens of [leaderboards](https://huggingface.co/blog?tag=leaderboard)! The OpenLLM Leaderboard is the most popular, but there are many others!
* Do research with a focus on unlocking the ecosystem in new directions. For example, we have The [Alignment Handbook](https://github.com/huggingface/alignment-handbook/tree/main). 

Our goal is not to train the best OS models. Our goal is to build the foundations and toolings that will enable the ecosystem to do the next generation of best OS models. We do have a research team! We have trained Zephyr, for example, which was one of the best fine-tuned back then. Our goal with Zephyr was not to train the best model, but to build the tooling and reproducible [recipes](https://github.com/huggingface/alignment-handbook/tree/main) that the community could use to train their best models, as well as getting DPO to work as many were struggling with it.

Similarly, we collaborated with ServiceNow and NVIDIA to do [BigCode](https://twitter.com/lvwerra/status/1738218476659945767/photo/1) where we released TheStack, a large permissively-licensed code dataset. Although there were some trained models, the main artifact is the dataset, and we saw a large number of models, such as Replit Code, Salesforce CodeGen, StableCoder, DeciCoder, WizardCoder, and more, come out of it! And that's exciting!

Our research is always around empowering and enabling the ecosystem, and we take a strong collaborative (rather than competitive) approach to this. Personally, I'm quite excited about the last 10 months in the ML ecosystem and looking forward to where the open-source community goes next!"
690,"Their business model is not developing chatbots, nor their purpose in the ML community, they are advocating to open source ML and encouraging everyone to use them as a repository for AI resources including models, datasets and papers"
691,"Just curious, why do you think HF would shift from being an open source player to suddenly start making chatbots? They don't develop their own models AFAIK."
692,Maybe they just thought that there are too many and it‚Äôs too hard to make money from it. That‚Äôs what I would think!
693,"During a goldrush, it's better to sell shovels than dig for gold"
694,https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta
695,They have less gpu‚Äôs
696,"Because I'm using half of the resource to finetune 120b model for filthy shrek erotica. I mean that's what people are doing, and wasting their resources. Totally not me, no siree!\~"
697,"When there‚Äôs a gold rush, sell shovels"
698,"Let me tell you. I appreciate their GitHub model path, but HF codebase is THE MOST ANNOYING thing I have ever dealt with. It fails for no reason. API renames literally every version. Documentation is like Microsoft's, I mean, it's not even exist. I have to dig into the CODE to find what is the error it is throwing.

The reason why? The code sucks. Recently they also integrate timm, which is already infamous for random breaking changes."
699,That's how you survive the game with less risk. Just like TSMC don't make their own chips but help AMD Nivdia and Apple make their chips and let them fight to death.
700,HF Chat ka thriving.
701,"Because they're **bad** at *business and strategy.* 

Great tech, but if you want to make money, you need either a platform or a solution and during the ""irrational exuberance"" phase you need to monitize and get out before investors see another squirrel."
702,They already have one just nobody takes them seriously beyond becoming a GitHub for ML
703,HF doesn't have top talent. The average programmer doesn't have the ability to innovate
704,"being honest, with the LLM explosion they are really cementing this path."
705,Databricks
706,But they're in a position where they can do both

712,Do you know what they were at the beginning?
713,"I get it but this isn't a good analogy when everybody already took this advice and now the gold itself is literally supershovels. 

The majority of the value in this field will be in market facing applications.

I feel like the more direct ""selling shovels"" analogy in their case would be if they started allowing developers to opt-in to selling paid access to cloud instances of their huge library of various open source models via different endpoints with one HF API key so they can be used in applications easily. Maybe they can't use one foundation model as good as GPT-4 but having access to a bajillion fine tunes for many different specific tasks could be its own paradigm, like a meta-MOE. I can even imagine them maybe making tools to contextually select appropriate models for a given task or input given their benchmark tools and data, for example. Compare their outputs with each other, select the best output, pay everyone involved a small cut while charging for the compute."
714,This is just a fine tune of Mistral!
715,"As a crappy coder I had begun to suspect this but didn't really have the experience to make the conclusion. I wasn't sure if I was doing things wrong or just unlucky.

I just started playing with HF and went from amazed to mildly disappointed in a matter of days.  I was impressed that I could get  something running so quickly, then frustrated with bugs getting it to run faster locally.

Running in half precision in PyTorch isn't supported for cpu only (at least for the models I tried)

EDIT someone helped me figure this out, I had to set the dtype to bfloat16 instead of just float16.

The Better_transformers lobrary doesn't support blip2-opt models because of a known issue where it checks to make sure the model is called blip2, but it won't accept blip2-opt.  The fix has been in a PR for months, so I switched to blip2-flan. 

At which point I learned that better transformers wont work if the whole model won't sit on ram, because someone changed the name of offload_folder to offload_dir. This seems like a pretty easy fix but the issue has been sitting for months.

The documentation for ORT and PyTorch Script is well over my head, but I'll keep chipping away at it as this is a learning project anyway."
716,$4.5 Billion disagree.
717,"Companies that have a strong collaborative vision tend to attract strong product people. That includes product managers and product-minded developers, etc. If the market fit execution works out. it tends to be a self-enforcing mechanism to get the people they need to cover what they need. If I were HF, I would keep on what they're doing to hook developers/companeis to their platform, but I'd ratchet up their enterprise products/integrations around end to end model provenance, content attribution, cybersecurity etc. Those are where a lot of the attractive profits are, I think from where they're at now."
718,Damn that's kind of sad if true lol. They rejected my job application without even a phone call. And I had publications in ICCV and ICLR.
719,Why is Databricks valued at[$43 billion](https://www.databricks.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/databricks-raises-series-i-investment-43b-valuation) while Huggingface is 'only' [$4.5 billion](https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/24/hugging-face-raises-235m-from-investors-including-salesforce-and-nvidia/)?
720,Do one thing and do it really well
721,So they are doing the more profitable and safer of the two?
722,Golden shovels
723,"But I *need* an AI chatbot!

Mostly because I don't know how to talk to real humans and they scare me.

From a business perspective, AI is a tech, *not* a solution and people don't buy tech + we're in web4 irrational exuberance."
724,Perhaps! Maybe we can also do a turbo emoji version that duplicates the amount of emojis
725,Why would anyone want this
726,Are there any good ways to quantise gemma to awq or gptq? Both autoawq and autogptq seem to not support gemma yet... (there's a branch for gemma in autoawq but after fine-tuning the model outputs junk)
727,"I know they were originally a chatbot for teens, but that is way too far back in the past now."
728,"I mean, the real shovel-sellers are NVIDIA of course"
729,what do you mean? pretraining masterrace?
730,Part of those issues are due to the nature of Pytorch. Realistically if you really want every bit of performance the better path is to ditch some of the huggingface stuff and use straight Pytorch or libtorch for model training and inference. But that takes a bit of effort as there's a steep learning curve. Huggingface tools do reduce that learning curve for most people and make it more approachable for scientists and researchers to experiment. It's similar to how sagemaker is decent for distributed model training and reasonable enough for people to use without having to devote a ton of time to learning the other stuff. But to really scrape every bit of performance out of a system it's too inefficient and torch distributed and NCCL are better.
731,"You and I will get a bunch of downvotes by HF enthusiast. But anyway, what you say is exactly what I mean. I believe that you don't need to ""have to try a bunch of models to determine if it's crap or not"". No. When one model is crap, the whole thing probably is.

  
HF is best for inference, but when you want to customize it, things will roll downhill quickly."
732,"Time for school my ML eggheads.

HF has #30-$50M in revenue in 2024 and is likely not making any money at all (it's expensive). 

Valuation is $4.5B, if it was making $200M and spinning off $100M in EBIT, the payback timeframe would be bad, unless you really wanted that IP, there is no exit.

Ask the folks at airtable."
733,Because databricks extorts you per cpu hour as its autoscaler gives you 30 nodes with 30 cpus that sit at 1% utilization
734,Can't put a value on open source I reckon
735,"What data is gathered from customers, I'd imagine, accounts for the massive valuation disparity. Since HuggingFace is 'the Github of deep learning models' there's not a lot of novel data passing through their systems, I'd argue. Databricks, on the other hand, is being utilized by hundreds or thousands of companies and industries whose data has never passed through machine or deep learning models 'til now. Because of Databricks' UI ‚Äì having a low code and regular / code-based ecosystem ‚Äì many orgs who are attempting to build their first ML or DL models or pipelines are using Databricks. (Source: I consulted for a 30-year-old SaaS company that has basically only one competitor, worldwide, who was building its first batch of ML, DL models. Prior to them starting to trial Databricks, the company's data was under lock and key because they had contracts with the US government.) Thus, back to that 'novel data' notion that I mentioned earlier. 

EULAs, ToS documents, and other dull legal documents often provide some insight into the kinds of data that these online service providers hoover up. For example, please see `1.26.` in Databricks' _Master Cloud Services Agreement_ (and, yes, there are two different quotation marks in the original text ‚Äì `‚Äú` and `""` ‚Äì which I left in their original format so that a Ctrl+F search matches) :

> **1.26. ‚ÄúUsage Data""** means data and telemetry collected by Databricks relating to Customer's use of the Platform Services. Usage Data may contain queries entered by an Authorized User but not the results of those queries

737,"And god dam, they do it well."
738,"IMO they've capitalized the ML model marketplace sorta thing. 

As applied ML grows people will be looking for one stop AIO solution. Since they have a competitive edge if they stick to it it'll payoff in the long run.

Similar to what Nvidia did by only focusing on GPUs and not manufacturing CPUs"
739,"Yup, AI/ML is just another hammer for solving focused problems. By itself it's really not a magic solution. Also most consumers really have no need or actual desire for AI chatbots. Even most researchers and engineers don't find chatbots interesting or useful for their problems."
740,"Very true. Maybe we could go 1 ""turtle"" down and say TSMC is laughing all the way to the bank with all of society."
741,I dont understand what you mean but yes fine-tuning is nothing compared to full pre-training
742,This sounds like a good assessment based on my very limited experience.
743,"I don't think I've hit quite the level of frustration you have, at least not yet. I think it's great to be able to try lots of models so quickly and easily. I'm excited by that, and by the potential HF has to also help get stuff into production if they can plug some holes.

But I'm also disappointed by how many bugs I ran into.

750,"It seems like you, me and countless others have come to the conclusion that the context on Perplexity when uploading files is limited. It's probably capped at 32k or around it. Unfortunately Perplexity's team has been very silent on this topic so we don't really know if this is intentional or a bug or if they are going to increase it.  


P.S. you can try using Gemini 1.5 Pro with 1M context: [https://aistudio.google.com/app/](https://aistudio.google.com/app/)

763,I Have used the you.com  search engine but have not tried the beta feature of file upload yet
764,I will definitely try that and follow-up.
765,"It's very simple to convert a PDF into a text file  (at least if there aren't a bunch of charts and other visual stuff in the doc) - Mac has this functionality natively; not sure about Windows. 

I mention this cause Claude Haiku (no Opus, but still pretty damn good) is available at [https://labs.perplexity.ai/](https://labs.perplexity.ai/). You can go there and just paste the text from a converted PDF into the textfield, along with the prompt / instructions and hit enter. You get a 200k context window and no text input limit - you could give it 199k tokens of text to process if you wanted (and were happy with the response being <1k tokens long). Additionally, there are no rate limits (well prob are, but I haven't bumped up against them.)  Best of all, it's completely free (no login / account needed) ha  


Obviously not a workaround or alternative to being able to use the main product and models there for PDF/file uploads, but still, worth keeping in mind if really needing to parse long docs (and I doubt it'll be available like this indefinitely)."
766,"According to Perplexity, PDF is a readable format. What alternative format would you recommend?"

Any assistance would be appreciated, I do enjoy talking to chatgpt via siri.."
777,Anybody having issues after the iOS 17 update?
778,"Has anyone gotten this to work for ios17?  I get all sorts of errors from not know which version of gpt to us, to being logged out of chatgpt, to unable to access helper app."
779,"Amazing shortcut! I was using a modified version of a shortcut that someone shared here. It essentially removes the citation numbers from the answer, but the answer is still a bit too long. This solves that. Thank you so much!"
780,"Thanks for the shortcut. Would it be possible to copy the answer given by Perplexity or Chat GPT ? There is only the button OK, and long answers are not fully visible on iPhone."
781,"Thank you so much for this shortcut!

I use Perplexity the most and agree with you in its helpfulness.

The shortcut worked great once, but now I keep on getting the error ‚Äú‚Ä¶cannot find the right ChatGPT model to use‚Ä¶‚Äù 

FWIW, I‚Äôm a premium ChatGPT user, but it‚Äôs going to expire today or tomorrow, so maybe that will alleviate the conflict."

784,"What's better about ChatGPT's output vs. Perplexity's output? This is the first time hearing about Perplexity, so I am curious"
785,Likely because you don't have the Perplexity app: [https://apps.apple.com/app/id1668000334](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1668000334)
786,"yes, I'm also having issues with the perpelxity app shortcut itself too. both the app and yours seem to generate the question in perplexity, but then fail to speak it with an error"
787,Same here somebody!?..anybody..?
788,"how do you do this? I have a shortcut working as wall, but also want to remove the citations. Would you be able to share the shortcut? Would love to learn from it to modify mine! Thanks!!"
789,If I ask via Siri and see the response on the screen I can scroll. You can simply add a copy to clipboard action.
790,"Also, if you open the chatgpt app it will have the complete conversation there. So even if you don‚Äôt ask for more details, you can always see them later."
791,That's strange. Make sure the Ask ChatGPT action is set to GPT-3.5. I'm a premium user too - that shouldn't affect it.
792,"So when you initiate the shortcut via Siri it will read everything out loud, but you can always add a Speak Text action after the Ask ChatGPT action."
793,"You, me, and others. If you don't indicate the model in the Ask ChatGPT action it usually works."
794,"ChatGPT just puts it in a format that‚Äôs readable and easy to hear via Siri, taking out the bracketed citations too."
795,"Perplexity searches the internet for your question and then uses GPT to read the results and write an answer based on that. It‚Äôs a lot more accurate for search-type queries compared to ChatGPT. 

I think of ChatGPT as a reasoning engine, not a search engine. Perplexity combines that reasoning ability with search. 

There are other products that are similar, for example Bing chat, but in my opinion Perplexity is better and faster."
796,Thankyou - I  overlooked one thing ‚Ä¶ The obvious!!
797,"For sure! Here‚Äôs the link: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/afe14bac739948e5937ea581ff8109dd

I think the one they posted on this thread is better on paper, but it can be a bit unreliable/slow. This one talks more but works most of the time and really fast. The only downside is that by not sending the first response to ChatGPT there is no memory to continue the conversation."
798,"Here is an updated shortcut that should get rid of some of the issues people have been experiencing, including Siri stopping speaking partway through the response. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/a10fbaacc607481896339e4379e9bbdb"
799,"Yes, it‚Äôs on GPT-3.5. Screenshot are [here.](https://imgur.com/a/KVtxlfh)"
800,"It does not seem to read aloud by default for me, and for some reason activating the shortcut (with a read aloud action) works with tapping it, but invoking by Siri only ever results in text output even with the read text action

801,"great, thank you for sharing so quickly! I will check it out!"
802,update: thanks again for sharing. this is a cool solution to replace the index items with the repeat loop. Just added that to my own shortcut :)
803,Hmm... No idea. I wonder if it has something to do with the ChatGPT app. Maybe others have an idea.
804,">https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/a10fbaacc607481896339e4379e9bbdb

This works great! Thank you!"
805,Im facing the same problem I posted about it on the subreddit
806,"Same thing for me. It worked yesterday, but doesn't anymore."
807,If you remove the model number it works ive just tried it
808,"Yes, thank you, it works after removal of the model number. I added an action to save the result in a new draft (Drafts app). Very handy."
809,How do you remove the model number? My options seem hardcoded
810,To me thats very harsh of them imagine having to go through all my shortcuts and changing each one by one
811,Click the GPT 3.5 and clear the variable
812,"try this in perplexity pro.

1. set Ai model to claude 3 opus

2. set focus to writing

3. toggle the pro button to off

now compare this with the output of claude 3"
813,In what way is Claude output better? What sort of tasks did you compare?
814,"I‚Äôm not impressed with the ‚Äúfollow up‚Äù in Perplexity. It‚Äôs not a conversation as it restarts the next prompt without including the previous question/answer in context. Claude has been excellent, and ChatGPT has a bunch to offer."
815,"I find it's extremely good for roleplay, in fact some of the responses from the Claude 3 output is amazing, chatgpt does a good job for switching up conversations, but claude 3 is 10/10 for setting it up in writing mode."
816,"Did a thorough comp a few weeks back for work, so be aware results may have changed as models evolve. Included Gemini, Pi and interestingly Chat GPT 3.5. If you don‚Äôt need sources, for at least some topics 3.5 blows 4 out of the water."
817,Add Gemini 1.5 to the mix you might be surprised
818,When are we getting Haiku for free users?
819,use perplexity at 10 first month: [https://perplexity.ai/pro?referral\_code=2Q6B1INX](https://perplexity.ai/pro?referral_code=2Q6B1INX)
820,"The main problem in Claude is that it doesn't have internet access, therefore answers can not be up-to-date. I think having internet access in real time is a major advantage. Am i missing something here?"
821,"I just canceled my subscription. Syntax highlighting doesn't work for c#, on copy paste in windows it leaves text with source large font and responds with small font, the audio commands are bad on android app and they have no integration for browser. Chatgpt is great at all of theese. I like the idea of perplexity but not the implementationat this point."
822,This is the way
823,"Why turn off the ""pro"" button? I thought it removed Opus."
824,"Is it better? Why/how? Doesn‚Äôt writing focus remove the search option? 

Any clarity would be really appreciated!"
825,"Is this better than claude 3 itself? Is the followup good? Also, I heard that the context length is shorter. Is that true?"
826,Yeah I want to learn more about how you set up your experiment and comparison. Not to be too critical but I feel context is really important when making statements regarding the effectiveness of one model vs another.
827,"I asked them to wrap up the best practices of doing some specific marketing tasks, and Claude 3's output was surprising the most comprehensive and accurate one."
828,I love perplexity and for me this is the biggest complaint I have about it compared to ChatGPT or Claude. The context it remembers for the follow up questions is so hit or miss. It often treats it like a new topic unless I‚Äôm doing something wrong.
829,"Same unfortunately! The only workaround is using Perplexity in browser to edit the original prompt to include the follow up. 

If I know it‚Äôll be a long conversation, I‚Äôll just switch into ChatGPT"
830,Agreed!
831,"I feel gemini pro is bad at least from a coding point of view i gave  gpt 3.5, gemini pro, claude free ver to create a simple gui calculator, gemini was unable to create one"
832,I thought there was a perplexity ai extension on chrome does that not help?
833,How does it compare with normal claude3 from anthropic??
834,"as much as i understood is that the pro button adds extra instructions and the model asks you follow up questions to refine the query. while if the pro button is set to off, the mosel behaves like how default Opus would.

pro button doesn't have to do with turning off the model you chose, its controlled from the settings page instead."
835,pro is just an additional model reasking questions about your questions to find better search results.
836,"try to understand it this way. any other focus types add extra limitations to the searchable data. but the writing focus is plain simple model you chose on the setting page (like gpt4, claude3 for pro users and default perplexity model for free users) . 

A plain simple model without any limitation on quotable sources works on the data it was originally trained on. and it processes a more coherent answer.

writing focus with pro button toggled off is not limited to any fixed sources but all of its training data. its like if you were asked to form your opinion with the limited constraints , your answer would be different than how it would be if you were asked to answer it freely. the writing focus just retains that freedom of the model you are using."
837,"Did you try putting perplexity in ""writing"" mode? This ignores specific internet sources and may be better for some generic advice summaries"
838,"I really hope I‚Äôm just not using it correctly and there‚Äôs something I‚Äôm missing because sources are a great feature. I find Perplexity good for quick and easy Q/A searches as it‚Äôs basically a RAG for Google Search. For refining and conversational generation for content or code, I‚Äôll use ChatGPT or Claude, respectively."
839,Same for me.  Follow up is hit or miss
840,1.5 pro or 1 pro ?
841,Thank you for the explanation! Is Claude 3 Opus still better just for writing though? Or are you saying they are the same?
842,writing mode and pro mode toggled off . perplexity should work similar to claude 3 i believe
843,1 pro ig
844,claude 3 opus is the best over-all model out there. focus is different thing. focus provides constraints the model has to work within. in writing focus there are less constraints in comparison with other ones.
845,"It seems to combine web indexing with OpenAI's LLMs. Its stated goal is to be an AI search engine. They originally started with peer reviewed research, but have expanded to the entire web. I've greatly enjoyed using it as a tool, as it serves a different set of use cases than general purpose LLM chatbots. Citations by default and fast performance significantly enhance the speed at which I can find information. I envision Google search gradually becoming more like this over time. I believe there is a privacy setting on the desktop web page if you have an account that supposedly allows you to prevent your queries from being used for training."
846,Can it handle rewriting things to make it sound better?
847,Not clear what distinct value it provides over google search with generative ai.
848,Google is now testing something similar to this and I hope they bring it to mobile website soon.
849,"This is very helpful, but is it documented somewhere? Since they claim the pro version uses gpt4, I would guess the free one uses 3.5. 

This kind of app seems to be a real threat to the Google business model - unless they start embedding ads in the results."
850,Yes. It has a writing mode and the pro version uses GPT 4. You can also upload documents.
851,In many cases it can directly answer questions. You won't need to browse the search results let alone open the actual pages. Especially when the questions get more complex the results can be quite stunning some times.
852,"There is a lot of overlap in this space. Perplexity was one of the first free LLMs to have a phone app, but now several do. There are lot of great projects out there, but few have the resources or staying power of Google or Microsoft, even if they have a better mousetrap."
853,"This is the main reason to use PPLX or any other alternative to Google. Because Google monopoly has  stopped search innovation during the last 10 years.

We need more competition. The proof is that just now (!!) when other companies has accomplished to offer better search experience than Google, they are seriously working to not die in the next 3 years."
854,Yes - the free version uses GPT 3.5. Web indexing is aided by Microsoft Bing. This is their original launch tweet: https://twitter.com/perplexity\_ai/status/1600551871554338816?s=20
855,Thanks!
856,"Perplexity doesn't do web indexing. The web has already been indexed. Perplexity uses apis provided by google and bing.

857,"it seems bing search api only provide links, still following the linking to download ,and then split and do embedding etc.? or only use snippets?"
858,Perplexity is my personal vote for best implementation and use of gpt apis.
859,This is obscenely fast.
860,"Wow, quite fast indeed. What's the story behind this one?"

867,"how much integers have between 0 and 2009 which have product of digits equals 42 ?  
LLaMa served by Perplexity Labs  
To find all integers between 0 and 2009 whose product of digits is equal to 42, we need to find all pairs of numbers whose product is 42 and one of the numbers is between 1 and 2009 (inclusive).  
There are only two such pairs: (6,7) and (7,6), since their product is 42. Therefore, there are only two integers between 0 and 2009 with this property: 67 and 76.  
what about number 1237?  
LLaMa served by Perplexity Labs  
My apologies for missing that earlier! The product of the digits of 1237 is indeed 42, so it also meets the criteria. Thank you for pointing out the mistake.  
there is 26 such numbers

868,they feel a lot like huggingface- stores lots of models and provides a platform for running them. ofc huggingface is greater in volume and more established and perplexity goes deeper per model
869,It‚Äôs almost dumb how fast it is.

873,"Personally I only use it as a google alternative. I didn‚Äôt even realise it had hugging face style functionality, I‚Äôll need to check it out!"
874,"a bit too fast, did you get good results? it's already hard to code with gpt4, and this is a lot lower in humaneval... i would prefer a slower model that makes less mistakes than a fast one that is useless"
875,Thanks
876,"no, i mean like it serves a similar purpose as a unitor of various models. huggingface is unique, tbh"
877,I had the exact same thought. Why wouldn‚Äôt they just implement arc search into the desktop browser?
878,"So, here they go introducing instant open / some kind of perplexity based search in Arc desktop... Are they now competing with Perplexity directly?"
879,Who said they won't üëÄ
880,üëÄ
881,Do you think it‚Äôs kind of a back stab?
882,To perplexity
883,"They restricted access to, I guess, every AI-Scraper? Didn't they introduce a standard like with robots.txt? I'm sure I've read that somewhere."
884,competition
885,"Using perplexity I have found many sites do this, probably as an anti-scraping or DDoS measure."
886,"Perplexity actually provides links. Something chatgpt has yet to do. Perplexity is amazing for school. I'm crushing every single assignment.

Though I'd say that Claude is the best of all of them."
887,They are scared of Perplexity
888,Interesting and maybe concerning
889,I never used it until now and I'm very impressed with it's capability to find some little known information. But like many AI it requires little bit steering.
890,What UI are you using? I don‚Äôt have this view on chat gpt pro
891,If true it is because they will soon release something similar.
892,"You can block the GPTBot from crawling *your* site. They didn't introduce a new standard, more published the details of their bot so that you can block it if you wish: 

[https://platform.openai.com/docs/gptbot](https://platform.openai.com/docs/gptbot)"
893,Really could you elaborate on why you like Claude I‚Äôve never tried it
894,Dario?
895,I just can't get great results out of Claude.  It seems like I'm not the only one:  https://chat.lmsys.org/?arena
896,"ChatGPT provides links, though not as consistently as Perplexity.  This is of course because Perplexity is built to be a search engine of sorts in a way that ChatGPT does not.

If you want to force ChatGPT to provide links you often have to tell it to ""look it up"" or ""bing it"" (ugh)."
897,"Yeah, what is better about Claude? I‚Äôm interested"
898,I tried out Perplexity expecting that I‚Äôd still mostly use ChatGPT. I‚Äôd say at least 80% of my AI chat requests are now through Perplexity Pro. It‚Äôs the most impressive tool I‚Äôve seen for quickly summarizing 20+ links from the web. I‚Äôd also wager my usage of Google is down massively due to Perplexity too.
899,perplexity is using openai api
900,"You're probably right and this is quite telling. I think Perplexity is a nobody compared to OpenAI so far as current adoption rates are concerned, and yet OpenAI has explicitly blocked them."
901,It can find peer-reviewed articles from extremely obscure places. It's quite amazing.
902,"I haven‚Äôt used perplexity yet, but are you sure this isn‚Äôt exactly what‚Äôs happening here? OpenAI getting blocked on some page it tried to ingest in order to respond, and perplexity is passing through that error?"
903,"Better convergence of ideas, more succinct"
904,It‚Äôs subjective but Claude can win in writing style to some people
905,"Claude is incredible at creative writing. It blows my mind. Need evidence? Check my fanfiction link on my profile. Claude and I wrote it together. It also synthesizes info better, can take large masses of text, can pull straight from the context to provide evidence on why its output has come out the way it has. There are times, too, when it really feels like I'm talking to a fellow human being. It blows my mind.

When I'm working on a project, I am often times using both chat GPT and claude, however"
906,"Claude is incredible for creative writing. I practically wrote a 21k+ fanfiction with Claude. Check my profile so you can see what a human and ai can produce together. :) Also, Claude is great at extrapolating info and providing insights."
907,Ya same pattern for me. Google tends to be a last resort now.
908,"Agreed. Between ChatGPT Plus and Perplexity Pro, I get most of what I'm looking for online. 

For me personally, Google is now largely reserved for 'lazy' searches where I'm just idly querying something out of habit I guess."
909,Same here.
910,Its using more than just openAI
911,Perplexity is the best at searching the internet and gathering info. I don‚Äôt know this wasn‚Äôt a higher priority for other companies but everybody in tech now wants a piece of perplexity
912,"I started to use it a lot lately - the UX is pretty good, able to do a few hours of research in 20 mins. Its not a ChatGPT replacement though but I believe it competes with something OpenAI is about to release - rumor has it OpenAI is going to launch a search alternative to Google"
913,This isn't a page ingested by OpenAI. It's a page ingested by Perplexity which is hosted at OpenAI (like any other webpage).
914,So is GPT-4. Anecdotes don't mean much.
915,I totally get this. Perplexity over Google..any day.
916,Perplexity is the best for finding links. The best.
917,SO .. alternative to bing AI

919,"I thought perplexity is passing your prompt (or some internal prompt derived from it) to OpenAI. If that‚Äôs not the case then I‚Äôm just off base, fine. But if it is, then why can‚Äôt it be GPT trying to access some external resource but getting blocked?"
920,Not so sure about that. It's my take. I've used multiple chatbots for almost a year now. I've produced loads of work through them; and I still determine Claude as the best for creative writing.
921,"What are they doing differently from other services like Webpilot, etc?"
922,Yes

924,"My understanding, based in part on being a Perplexity user, is that Perplexity is a search engine like Google that uses OpenAI to render the answer to the question into an ""answer"" instead of just a list of links. It may or may not also use OpenAI to pick the right relevant links using embeddings.

In the context where we saw the word ""OpenAI"" in the picture, it's just another web page like any web page. Along with the answer, it was trying to show two pages from GitHub, one from OpenAI and based on the icons, a WordPress page and a few more Github pages etc.

Because the QUESTION was about GPT 3.5, it is not surprising that Perplexity's engine might think that OpenAI is the right place to get the answer, quite independent of the fact that they are also, themselves, OpenAI customers and will use OpenAI  APIs to summarize the information they get from OpenAI's website."
925,"Same

I game master pathfinder and starfinder. And I give claude a description of a scene and turn it into a cool description for the players.

926,"What I mean is it's not going to be a search engine the way people know and use Google.

These ai bots aren't meant to be competitors to search or find ways to that generate tons of ad revenue. OpenAi most likely wants to optimize search to find data that is very high quality as a way to increase the quality of models. There is some research they have published on the matter."
927,"Also if your question is something not search related it will search, then discard the results and return a slightly condensed version of exactly what GPT4 responds. I‚Äôve tested a few times and when it gets the answer directly from OpenAI, it‚Äôs nearly word for word what the same prompt gets from ChatGPT directly."
928,"The animation looks smooth. Is this a load screen animation? Also, what tool are you using to animate?"
929,[deleted]
930,curious why the center line takes on a sudden thickness at the end
931,Yes. The animation happens when the AI's answer is loading. I took reference from [PerplexityAI's](https://www.perplexity.ai/) chat and recreated the animation using [Lottielab](https://www.lottielab.com/).

Just a word of warning before you go on to use AI for search."
938,"I'd never tried Perplexity AI so I thought I'd visit the site and ask it this question: ""why is everybody pushing for AI search engines when they are less reliable than traditional search engines?""

This was the answer:

> The push for AI search engines is driven by the potential to enhance certain aspects of traditional search engines. While AI search engines have been criticized for being less reliable than traditional ones, there are efforts to improve their accuracy. AI language models have been found to present falsehoods as facts and lack supportive citations
 However, companies like Google and Microsoft are working on making AI-generated search summaries more accurate by linking to sources and addressing the fundamental problem of AI models making up information
 Despite the challenges, AI-powered search engines are considered a significant challenge to traditional search engines and are seen as a new way to discover accurate and up-to-date information
 While there are concerns about the reliability of AI search engines, efforts are being made to address these issues and enhance their capabilities

Basically: ""AI search engines *are* less reliable than traditional search engines, but large tech companies are trying to improve them"". 

There was a suggested question underneath asking what the benefits of AI search were, and even that said that it was unreliable.

Here's another question: ""in what ways do ai search engines mitigate or contribute to the spread of misinformation?""

> AI search engines can contribute to the spread of misinformation in several ways, including:
Inaccurate search results: AI language models can sometimes present falsehoods as facts, which can lead users to believe and spread misinformation. Insufficient citation checking: When AI-generated text looks authoritative and cites sources, it could ironically make users less likely to double-check the information they're seeing, as they may perceive the information as credible. Algorithm limitations: Algorithms used by AI search engines may not be able to detect and flag misinformation effectively, as misinformation can be subtle and context-dependent. This can result in the spread of false information through search results. Trustworthiness concerns: The use of AI in search engines raises questions about the trustworthiness of the information provided, as AI systems can be manipulated or influenced by human factors

> However, there are efforts to mitigate the spread of misinformation through AI. For example, Logically AI uses a Human in the Loop AI framework called HAMLET (Humans and Machines in the Loop) to detect online misinformation at scale while adhering to trustworthy AI principles. Additionally, initiatives like the one conducted by Logically AI focus on increasing transparency and promoting fairness in AI systems to improve trust in AI-generated information

Again, ""this is harmful, but there are people trying to make a future iteration less harmful"".

As an aside, you can set *anything* as your default search engine in pretty much every other browser out there. Why does Arc limit what you can use?"
939,Will there be a way to replace the ChatGPT as the second search engine with this?

941,"I still don't understand AI search engines. In Google I'm used to typing in youtube pressing enter and then clicking on youtube. With AI search engines, it feels like they are for when you want to look up information without clicking on multiple links. Can you still use AI search engines to navigate to specific sites, or is it only for asking questions? Someone help me better understand AI search engines."

945,Awesome! Been using Perplexity for a while now by adding it as a quick search? in Arc (where you can type perplexity then tab and search) and I've been really enjoying using it. Maybe when this comes out I'll give it a go as my default.

947,I already have it set up like this. Just get the perplexity extension it works.¬†
948,"I do sincerely wish that users don't see the words ""AI"" and back off. Perplexity is not just a wrapper around ChatGPT, but a search engine that, imo, is actually nicely designed for its purpose. It is one of the few AI products that leverages AI with creativity.

Nicely implemented AI features are great, like 5-second previews, and Perplexity imo. Some poorly done ones basically engineer a custom prompt and slap on the ""AI feature"" tag when they are basically just a reskin of ChatGPT - those are the ones that we should back off from (like Microsoft Copilot), but not every product/feature we see.

TL;DR - not every AI product/feature is BS."
949,"Why are those search engines pictured above different from what I have? I have Ecosia, which isn't pictured above, and Neeve, which seems to have merged with Snowflake (so Arc might need to fix that or remove it.), and I do not have Perplexity AI as pictured above. I'm on the most up to date version of Arc on macOS."
950,"So it's just a summarized answer search as opposed to search results? Feels so abnormal searching and not scrolling my head off lol what do people really think of it as a potential replacement of a search engine?

Can we please get Brave search as a default finally please? DuckDuckGo lost its cred awhile back."
951,"I accidentally deleted the Perplexity search engine from Arc, so it no longer shows up in my options; anyone know how I can get it to show up again? (Way to reset that part of the browser while maintaining my settings, or downloading something, or...?)"
952,"This, I always tend to turn off all the AI stuff.. honestly it is fine for simple tasks but as soon as you ask any AI a complex technical question it either says complete nonsense or straight up lies. Perplexity is just another wrapper around ChatGPT so I don't expect it to be useful for anything else than writing school assignments. You just can't rely on it and if I have to double check everything myself I'm doing double the work.

I think AI is useful for example if you're familiar with Warp terminal - having the AI there to write complex bash commands for me is great, but it's just not reliable enough to replace google and common sense."

But I assume (big assumption) the majority of users don't even know what a search engine is (at least a lot of people I know don't; they just say ""Google"" for both Chrome and Google Search), no less how to change one, or that it can be changed.

-Be Specific and Detailed->The more specific your prompt, the better the image quality. Describe the mood or atmosphere you want to convey, the number of people or objects in the scene, and their interactions. For instance, instead of saying ""a park,"" you could say ""a bustling park on a sunny day with three children playing on a swing set and a couple having a picnic under a large oak tree"".

-Use Descriptive Language->use adjectives and descriptive phrases to provide more context and detail. For ex,, instead of ""a sunset sky over the sea,"" you could specify ""a fiery red sky over a calm blue sea""

-Specify Art Styles->If you have a particular art style in mind, include it. ""photo-realistic,"" ""illustration,"" ""Van Gogh style,"" and so on

-Front-load Important Information->DALL-E prior the words at the start of the prompt. Put important things first

-Iterative Refinement-> initial prompt may not produce what you desire.

-Keep It Simple But Specific->Start with simple prompts using clear and concise language, avoid complex and abstract concepts

-Experiment with Different Combinations-> can create unique and unexpected images that showcase the full range of DALL-E‚Äôs capabilities.

-Use Metaphors and Similes->More abstract

-Respond only with prompt if another instructions were not given.

1019,"https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-is-Perplexityai-DG6870sbTHWqZWFwtsX98A?s=c

""Perplexity.ai Labs is a division of Perplexity AI that provides a playground for developers to try out the company's LLM (Language Model) technology. It offers an API for developers to integrate the LLM technology into their applications...."""
1020,Seems the same as the 'normal' perplexity - are the APIs different?
1021,"In other words is a ""human interface"" (dashboard) where developers learning to use the PPLX API can test it without write code: try different models with different parameters, very easily.

Other services like OpenAI API also have the same ""service"". They simply named it ""Playground"".

This kind of interface usually is a paid service, based on consume you do. In this case, PPLX give you only access to PRO subscribers (OpenAI to any one), but PPLX give you FREE the first $5 USD of them month (is too much to do a lot of use!!).

So usually only developers use this kind of ""interfaces"", but you can do it too if have PPLX PRO subscription."
1022,"in the playground usually you find ALL THE MODELS, even the experimental. In the ""normal"" interface you don't, specially the NO-PRO.

Additionally, in the playground, you can adjust all the parameters that each model accepts (temperature, answer average length, etc.), which are very technical aspects that are usually not even mentioned in the ""normal"" interface but significantly alter the MODEL's response type.

You must understand that the ""normal"" interfaces (those used by 99.99% of users, including services like chatGPT) are ""optimized"" in this overly technical parameterization for the average user, aiming for 80% effectiveness in 80% of queries.

However, when a developer wants to tailor the use of a language model for a very specific purpose, it's much more effective to experiment with various parameter settings to achieve optimal utilization of the language model for the specific tasks needed in that project.

This is where the PLAYGROUND is so interesting: to play easily with more and more cases, samples, configurations, blablabla."
1023,ONLY PROBLEM IS API DOESNT CITE. IT DOES RESEARCH BUT DOESNT TELL WEBSITES
1024,"It's the same model, they can't ""water it down"" because they're just serving it to users via API. All Perplexity has control over is what is sent and received from the model, I imagine they added a context cap because Opus is expensive and models are charged per-token. A single Opus prompt with a full 200k token context would cost me $3 using the API. For a single conversation turn. They most likely have a better rate because of scale, but it's still expensive.

The only reason performance would be affected is if they have a bad system prompt, but I doubt that's the case. I use Opus directly via API and on Perplexity and it seems the exact same to me."
1025,I switched from ChatGPT Plus to Perplexity and I am amazed by Opus. It is so much better for many things. I have no comparison to the use of Claude via Anthropics website. But the Perplexity access to it is already great and I am able to use the model from Europe.
1026,"It's 600 messages a day. I don't have an Anthropic account to compare precisely, but the Perplexity version of Opus seems to have better reasoning than my GPT-4 sub. It's hard to tell for sure though, but when I use ChatGPT it gets lazy quickly, seems to be less-so with Opus through Perplexity Pro.


At the moment I also don't need a model with a giant context window for single message or file upload, so it's been great having Opus' reasoning. Soon enough Gemini will have a readily available huge context window if I need to upload PDF's.¬†"
1027,"Well it is actually interesting but in official chatgpt, the output context window is even shorter, so I am pretty happy about the current context window, and yes I agree it could get a little bit longer, but not a deal breaker for me. Another thing I notice is that follow-up question tend to forget things pretty easily, and this does not happen in offcial chatgpt at all, like when I ask it to continue, they will always continue the conversation (like finish tranlating the whole texts) seamlessly. But perplexity struggles to have consistence. I don't know why, probabaly they needs to tune more about it."
1028,"Ist it 600 messages per day?  
""Unlimited Pro SearchPro Search is our most powerful search, ideal for longer answers to complex questions. (300+/day)"""
1029,"If perplexity Claude Opus gives the same quality answer as the original Claude Opus, it is not sustainable. Perplexity will lose money and have to close down eventually. Look at the API cost. Simply no way. I expect perplexity to somehow restrict the answer quality of heavy users."
1030,"It's been great. The difference is only in the context for the input and output. I have a long thread on both the Claude official site and a long search thread on Perplexity. Opus on the official site is able to recall everything, but on Perplexity, it can't recall the first 2 search results. Another disappointing thing I noticed is the shorter output. I think they limit the output to a 4k tokens max.

I was originally very disappointed using Opus on Perplexity, but using writing mode with Pro mode off has given me the same results as official site. It's not as watered down as I originally thought.  

I'm happy, especially with the 600 prompts per day, instead nearly 20 prompts per 8 hours. Plus, you get 2 of the best models for the price of one. Writing mode is exactly the same as cluade official site and chatgpt plus  classic without extra features.

The only request I'll have is that making the output token longer is writing mode."
1031,"It states also  :

""Pro search is limited to 600 uses per day.""

And:

""All of these models' queries are counted as uses in the same context as a Pro search. So, all of these have 600 uses per day.""

It show 600 message when i start. I have used 27 prompts today  and It say  I have 573 messages left to use right now."
1032,"Perplexity has a massive scale, they have a negotiated rate with Anthropic for sure. When Claude 3 first came out Opus in Perplexity had a 5 query limit because of how expensive it is, but then they updated it and made it unlimited. Clearly they made a deal in that time."
1033,"> The only request I'll have is that making the output token longer is writing mode. 

Yeah they should definitely adjust the brevity of the model in Writing focus. In search modes I want my answers brief so it's welcome, but in chat mode I only want them brief if I specifically ask for them to be brief."
1034,Obviously 300+/day is not wrong. But why do they state this number in the first place when the limit is 600? Maybe Perplexity wants to have the option to lower this limit at any point.
1035,"I hope you're right, though I remain skeptical. I'll believe it when heavy perplexity users verify their positive experience on reddit. Even though I'm skeptical, I don't know of a better deal at the moment. A similar alternative to perplexity would be [you.com](http://you.com)  
Didn't test it out myself."
1036,"It would be a really bad move for them to go from 5 a day, to unlimited, and back to restricted uses again. If they couldn't keep up with the costs they never would have lifted the restrictions. I would be shocked if this changed for that reason.

Do you think they're using some lower cost model and calling it Claude 3 Opus? I feel like that would open them up to a false advertising claim, since the site doesn't say anything about the models being modified. And it would be a terrible move from Anthropic because it would make people think Opus is worse than it is.

I think you may underestimating how much Anthropic needs Claude to be known about and used, and how much Perplexity needs a draw for users to pay for Pro and have a good experience using high quality models. Right now GPT-4 is ""the good AI"" and the only option considered for many people, partnerships like this could make a huge impact on name recognition and help Anthropic substantially in the long run.

And PPLX has deals with the Rabbit r1, the Brilliant Frame glasses, and I think a cell service provider in South Korea or something like that? All(?) of which include a year of Perplexity Pro, and will expose their users to Claude 3 Opus and how great it is. 

So they pen a deal for a rate that allows PPLX to serve unlimited uses of the model to paid users to let people really get a feel for how great it is, and both companies win long term.

I'm realizing I know way too much about this stuff haha."
1037,"Hmm ... Claude is cannibalizing its own revenue on its website because customers will be moving to Perplexity instead. Not complaining as a customer, of course. Happy to see that. Just find it strange from a business perspective."
1038,"Nobody will use Claude.ai if they don't know Claude exists/is great, and they don't have any of the promotions PPLX does. I think Claude.ai is another strategy to get the word out by allowing regular people to use it, more than a product they want to build up their company on.

I get the feeling their focus is APIs for businesses, not consumers. Tim in accounting tries out this ChatGPT alternative he heard about from a friend, he tells his coworkers how smart it is, eventually it reaches a decision maker. Now they know Claude exists, and they have a first hand positive experience.

The Claude.AI site is nice, but feels pretty bare bones. Whereas I've been using their API heavily since Claude 3 released and they have put a lot of effort into that experience. Their dev site is almost as feature packed as OpenAI's, and they have some of the best API documentation I've ever seen.

Anyway, just my thoughts."
1039,Bing Chat does this and so does Bard. Have you tried Bing Chat?
1040,"Personally, I find it inferior to https://phind.com. Give that a try as well, I find that out of the search connected LLMs, phind gives me the best results, followed by Bing Chat and Perplexity."
1041,Why does this and the comment about phind read like a shill post
1042,"Behind the scenes this is just the OpenAI API, right?"
1043,"Perplexity's been the best general search engine for me for the past few months, but Bing chat just caught up to it this week.

Unfortunately, Bing chat requires you to run Edge for now."
1044,"Well, it works better than Bing, and most important part for me was to be able to check the source. So I am pretty happy with the perplexity."
1045,"I tried, it is nice but I feel the search part is weak. It can't reference a page even when given by URL in the prompt - for example could not summarise YT comments on a video or extract information from a web page.

The thing I was searching for was found in the end on Google after using GPT-4 to suggest some keywords. I think the search index needs to be expanded a lot to be able to service very specialised searches.

Btw, initially GPT-4 did not even know the thing I was asking about (Alexander Borodin - Cello Sonata in B minor), tried to convince me it doesn't exist. Perplexity was OK with knowing on the surface but didn't get deeper into the topic."
1046,The only thing that it has going for it is the nice UI and branding
1047,"ChatGPT also can do this if someone add search result to ChatGPT.

And this is also great"
1048,"I use the perplexity.ai, but not very often.  
In spite of that, I think they are better than YOU.com"
1049,"No, I haven't used those much yet but I'll give them a try as well"
1050,"same, I can give phind really really bad prompts and somehow it will finds relevant links for them that are half decent."
1051,"Do we know anything about the underlying model for phind?  It seems to be very impressive for a 2-person effort.  I saw a random comment that it was based on Flan-T5, but I couldn't find any confirmation."
1052,"Cool, will try this out as well"
1053,How is it compared to you.com?
1054,[deleted]
1055,"No, I find it useful genuinely and am curious about what the approach is. Interested in potentially developing my own take on it if possible"
1056,"wait what, really?"
1057,"No, I kind of doubt it. The OpenAI API doesn't provide a way to site the model response sources directly so it would probably be very inefficient to do it that way. It's probably a different model"
1058,"Not really, there exists a Firefox/Chrome extension called ""Bing Chat for all Browsers"". It works for me on Firefox. https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bing-chat-for-all-browsers/"
1059,"Ah, you have some interesting expectations of it though. I do think it would be really interesting if a model like this had access to YouTube video transcripts so it could suggest parts of specific videos relevant to the prompt, but it doesn't do that for sure. It does seem to have a decent reach on reddit posts though"
1060,Upvote simply for having good taste. Borodin FTW.
1061,"It's using GPT4 (and GPT3.5) as the backing LLM. Their secret sauce is the semantic search, the embeddings and the search integration. Check [this HN thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35543668), the people involved are talking about the stack here and there."
1062,"Check my post history, no shilling there. Connecting LLMs to search just makes sense, but different implementations lead to different results and at this point I prefer phind. Easy to try, bing, phind and perplexity all can be used for free"
1063,">Check my post history, no shilling there. 

your post is full of DALL-E images while stable diffusion is much better"
1064,"My guy, when I used Dall-E there was no SD yet."
1065,Its an American startup
1066,"Perplexity is snake oil. It's a wrapper on GPT along with calls to Bing/Google. 

One of their own employees admitted to using Google search results as inputs to their LLM on r/llama subreddit IIRC.

There are many queries (knowledge queries, comparison queries, No One Right Answer (NORA) queries) which can be fulfilled by LLMs like Chatgpt / Claude / Gemini. 

For real time information, you really need to have feeds and indices in addition to LLMs, which involves a heavy infrastructure investment which perplexity doesn't have.

I don't see this as having any moat."
1067,It perplexes me
1068,But if you see results it's similar to Google & Phind will be large competitors for them because they make their own models rather than these gpt wrappers. Also both founded in 2022.

1073,"Weren't they just copying Google results?

And isn't this just GPT wrapper? Half a billion valuation for this?

UI anyways looks not so good. Wonder how they command such crazy valuation"
1074,Perplexity is horseshit. It is just a themed google search. Searching for anything more than a basic sentence comes back with searches of a single word from the prompt. It seemingly uses GPT 2 or something
1075,Wtf is the founder of Amazon doing in the middle of the pic.
1076,">San Francisco based

you worthless cretins never cease to amaze me. You sick fucks it's not an Indian startup, they are **AMERICANS**"
1077,I got their 1 year free trial. Its good as AI service aggregator because it has option to choose out of multiple models.
1078,"The PR on this guy is out of the world. Smells and sounds like a ""scam"""
1079,Perplexity is really bad. The worst of the lot.
1080,So much for a wrapper
1081,"I've tried perplexity and it's really not much better than any search engine with gpt ie bing ai, Gemini  etc

This is going to turn into one of those vaporware startups that tanks as soon as the AI bubble bursts"
1082,"Even if it was not wrapping gpt/bing/google apis in name of AI, legit AI startup would had been acquired by google/apple/Microsoft anyway in few years. They won't let a new player emerge in market from India."
1083,AI is the latest buzzword after NFTs. I wonder when will we see AI enabled cooking oil.
1084,"I saw this guy's interview , he can hardly talk sense & has ego of Bezos already. It's a just a university wrapper project , the funding & valuation might be a just scam for write offs"
1085,How did they get funding without MVP and revenue?
1086,Typical Indian crab mentality in comments
1087,"Seriously even i was trying to understand what exactly is their USP, just sitting on 3rd party LLM models and fleshing out results in good UI. People do might be using it free tier , i think the only bet they are playing is entering the enterprise market. I don't understand why would anyone pay unless they are heavily into making full use of the model results extensively"
1088,"Thanks.

Here's (yet) another blog on how to build a clone of perplexity with essentially two API calls and the right prompt.

1090,Well it's a lot better than using Google for finding answers quickly. I'm using it a lot more than Google these days
1091,Their moat is the money.
1092,"I thought the same thing until I started using it. Beats the shit out of Google. I used it extensively when purchasing my first apartment. I kid you not, it found out errors in my sales feed drafted by my lawyer, also ended up saving me 15k rupees because it told me I can deduct sales agreement duty from my final stamp duty. 

Also it being a wrapper around Claude and gpt4 is a plus, because I don't have to pay separately for gpt4 or claude anymore.

Also if they don't have any moat why aren't they seeing any competitors. Should've had at least one worthy competitor by now."
1093,"It's stupid to not use existing search engine rankings..?
What's the issue here.

Perplexity can slowly build it's own db of links, crawl and then use the ( open source ) page ranking algorithm."

1100,"The use case you mention would be the work of an LLM like gpt 4. Their competitors are GPT4 / Claude / Gemini already. Once the dust settles, a few amongst the many will be a lot better. They can close their api access to large scale usage at the time.

Are there other wrapper companies? Sure, but they don't market themselves as an alternative to search."
