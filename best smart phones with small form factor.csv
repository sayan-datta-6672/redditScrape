0,"It runs Android 11 with full Play Store access so it's been awesome getting things on here like Reddit, Google News, the Kindle app, etc. and not being restricted to the software preloaded by the manufacturer. A lot more than my Kindle Oasis can do despite being much smaller.

I've also been super impressed with how snappy and fast this thing is when navigating the UI, opening apps, waking up, turning on/off, etc. Much better performance than my Kindle or my Supernote."
1,am just waiting for one with color and sim card. Buying that on the first day
2,I have a Hisense Touch which is a similar size and love it too. So convenient
3,I am really tempted to pick one of these up to replace my Kindle.  I love the form factor.  I side load most of my books to my Kindle so being able to use another app that allows scrolling instead of page turns is also a plus.
4,Battery life?
5,"Are you using it with the front light on? How sharp is it without the front on?

What other apps have you got on it, like telegram or Whatsapp?"
6,Is this the perfect reddit phone ? Or the perfect phone for articles to read ? 
7,"Would something like this also have access to the kobo app and Libby? I’m not too familiar with the android software. I’m guessing this could be a really neat option for someone using a few different sources for books. I’m using Amazon, kobo and Libby but have both a kindle and a kobo device."
8,I want to get this but I’m afraid it will be too small to read. Does it bother your eyes at all? I would mainly use it to read books.
9,"Have you used the camera for scanning QR codes? I don't have an Android (or iOS) device, so I'm considering this for reading on the go + Duolingo without straining my eyes + things that require apps like Uber and Yulu (shared bike/cycle service in India).

Unfortunately I doubt banking apps will work because most of them insist you insert the SIM card of the number linked to your bank account...but it would come in handy for other things!"
10,Where did you purchase it?
11,any options for cell phone data
12,@Bossman1086 Would you be so kind to check if you can download the app „Shortform“? This would be the reason for me to buy this device
13,"That already exists! For example, check out the Hisense A7 CC."
14,"The form factor is pretty nice. It's small though. Make sure you'd be good reading on a smaller screen regularly. To me, it's a great companion device to my phone and an ereader I'll probably take with me when I don't want something as big as my Kindle. But if I'm traveling, I think the Kindle will still be better for me on the plane and such."
15,I've only had it for like 2 days so it's too early to say. I've only done 20 minutes of Kindle reading on it and less than an hour of news/reddit reading so far. Otherwise it's been sitting on my desk as a clock/calendar. It came at 83% battery and is currently at 64% without being charged.
16,"Yes, I'm using it with the light on. Default brightness settings. I turned it off for a bit and it was still perfectly sharp.

As for apps, I haven't installed any messaging apps. I got it as a companion device to get away from phone distractions and notifications so I avoided messaging, email, and most social media apps. But most of them should work since it's running Android 11 with the Play Store and a Snapdragon processor that was common in mid-range phones a couple years ago. Messaging apps will depend on whether or not they require a phone number though since this device has no SIM or phone number.

Apps I've installed include Pocket, Kindle, Brave, RedReader for reddit, Google News, Gboard, Play Books, Keep Notes, Open Camera, X, and Tachiyomi (side loaded)."
17,"It's not a phone. It has no SIM or mobile radios. No way to make calls. 

But yes. It's like reading on a phone but with an eInk display. So like reading on a Kindle, your eyes won't get sore reading for long periods of time on it. In my experience so far, it's been great for reading the news and browsing some text heavy websites. I don't do much reddit on mobile but it should be good for that if you're not in card view."
18,There is a Kobo app for Android in the Play Store. So you could definitely install that and read your books in that library on this device. I'm doing that with the Kindle app as that's where 90% of my eBooks are.
19,Hi what’s the difference between the kindle store and kobo store? Difference in pricing like Barnes and noble for nook?
20,"It's no different than reading on a phone screen (besides it being an eInk display, anyway). I read random articles and reddit posts on my phone all the time without issue. And eInk is even easier on the eyes than an AMOLED display in a phone.

No issues so far."
21,The device doesn't come with a standard camera app but you can download one from the store. QR code support depends on the camera app you get. There are also stand alone QR code reader apps in the play store that should work.
22,No. It's not a phone. No modems. Has WiFi and Bluetooth. That's it.
23,If you want data get a Hisense A9.
24,the size is not ideal for me. Plus i want one with the latest kaleido 3
25,"I have an iPhone 13 Pro Max so I've been experimenting with reading on it and the size is great.  Besides the fact that I'm just a sucker for a new gadget,  I think an E-ink screen would be a huge improvement plus it would keep me from distracting myself with my phone."
26,"Just to follow up, they came back in stock at B&H so I ordered one.  Christmas present to myself I suppose."
27,"Thank you, but I still need to find someone that has used it for reddit reading. Like literally most of my screen time I'm reading something so if this could be done on an e ink screen it would actually benefit my eyes. 

the problem with kindle is that it does not support a web browser. I have seen other boox products and I'm really tempted to buy one to try them"
28,Different book formats would be the biggest difference.
29,Ok thank you!
30,"Hmm, okay, I think one of those should work for me! Thanks :)"
31,"interesting just wanted clarification, would love one as a phone i kind of need less blue light into my eyes on the daily."
32,"I'd actually love this as a phone too, it'd do a great job as a 'digital detox' phone."
33,"I'd actually love this as a phone too, it'd do a great job as a 'digital detox' phone."
34,thanks ill look into it
35,This has full access to the Play Store. So almost any app you can download from there should work on this. I have installed the reddit app and it does work. I just haven't spent much time in it on this device. I don't see any reason why it wouldn't be good for reddit though. It's just not good for videos/gifs and photos because it's black and white.
36,"it'd be awesome if they came out with like 3 sizes (mini,regular,plus) with the next lineup! it would be awesome for people to have 3 options."
37,[deleted]
38,"Yes, please. I hope they don't make it the 'low-performance' version though.  "
39,Probably good to have a 4 inch option for some. But im never going back to that size after having a 4.7 inch screen. 
40,"I have left reddit for [Voat](https://voat.co/) due to years of admin mismanagement and preferential treatment for certain subreddits and users holding certain political and ideological views.  

   As an act of protest, I have chosen to redact all the comments I've ever made on reddit, overwriting them with this message.

42,"I personally prefer the 6, perfect size, the 5 seems way too tiny to me now. However, I know quite a lot of people that a perfectly happy with their 5 and were angry there was no new similar sized option. Why does everybody have to ""fight"" about what size is good, There is no reason why Apple shouldn't have three sizes and let people chose what fits best. The one size fits all approach has been disproven with the 6 plus"
43,"On other news: Apple leaking to the web to see if people want 4-inch iphones. Yes, please, bring them on."
44,"Good! The 5S is perfect.

Now that I think about it, the improvement will still have to be substantial. Nothing about the 5S makes me want to get a new phone right now."
45,"I just realized ""6s"" sounds like ""success""."
46,[deleted]
47,"Makes sense , would be a good addition for people that sre not keen on a 6"
48,4.7 is really perfect... but the non-screen parts of the phone take up way too much useless space.
49,"A 4,5, and 5.5 is all that's needed, all equally amazing hardware internally. "
50,A friend of mine clings to his 4s as in his opinion this is the form factor ever. I guess that's good news for him.
51,"Ugh. They need some goddamn universal naming conventions. 

Let's see what we can do. And let's pull out device numbers because it just gets muddled anyway.

"
52,"I would definitely go back to 4"" after trying the 4.7"" 6.  I just prefer the smaller size more.  It's easier for me to use IMO."
53,This rumor has been coming up since the release of iPhone 6. I hope it's true. I would buy it instantly. I'm unwilling to move from my iPhone 5S. 
54,Take my money 
55,After a month with the 6+ I never want to go back. I don't get the hate for the big size.
56,"have had iPhone's for a while and honestly, i bike a lot, and text. safe as it isn't, i do it all the time, well.. i used to, since the 6 is too rounded for me, thing is delicate AND feels like silk in my hand, with worries of constantly dropping it, i keep it safe more than i would use it. (even with walking, i'll wait a lot to check my phone, maps even.) i would rather a 5s over the 6 only because of the size versus texture of it, "
57,"I'll take a stab before I read the article.  Apple is ""considering"" because there is some demand.  "
58,"Out on the road today I saw a 4S sticker on a Cadillac. A little voice inside my head said ""Don't look back. You can never look back."""
59,A pocket-sized telemaphone?  Will wonders never cease?
60,"While I definitely embraced the larger sizes when the 5 and then 6 came out, not at all surprised that many people disliked it. Having three variations might be a bit cumbersome on the manufacturing end, but I'm sure there's demand."
61,"I have an iPhone 4 running iOS 7, so I am hurting for a new phone right now. however the 6 is too big for me. Torn between shelling out for a 5s or waiting to see if Apple does indeed produce a 4"" phone with Apple Pay built in."
62,Always good to have options! I wish my 6 plus was a bit bigger though... Maybe I should just get an iPad mini lmao
63,"I'd buy it ! but I dont like the sound of the ""mini"" kinda reminds me those cheap ""mini"" version of android flagships like the HTC One mini, LG G3 mini, it's kinda cheap...
could be the iphone air or something like that."
64,6 plus here...love it! Would never go back 
65,"I was surprised they did not do this from the start. They really do need to keep the original crowd in mind. Not everyone wants a big phone, not everyone wants a small phone. Put in the new processor and the new camera and leave the original size. 

As for the name, probably does not matter much. I don't think too many people really care about the name. iPhone classic, iPhone mini, iPhone JMS (just my size), iPhone Kiddie, iPhone SH (small hands), iPhone PF (pocket fit), iPhone phone (vs. tablet)"
66,"I'm glad I held off on the 6 then, because THIS is the one I want. I HAVE an iPad thank you, I don't watch movies on my phone. "
67,"Make the thing the same size and shape of the 5/5s so I can still use my old cases, and use the extra space in the housing for a bigger/longer lasting battery. Seems like a good idea, no?"
68,"Called it. Yes please, that's what I want."
69,This would make a lot of sense
70,I got a 6 and would definitely go back to a 4 inch screen but I love the 128gb too much. I guess a cheaper 4 inch 6c (or whatever it will be) with 128gb wouldn't make sense since the larger storage is for premium users.  Larger is better/faster/more expensive right?
71,I called this about a year ago
72,Well you'll find out in 10 months.
73,"As long as they can keep the specs as similar as possible I think that would be a smart move. 

That would mean that screen resolution, CPU, RAM, storage and camera should be as identical as possible and then have the differentiator be size. "
74,That would be my next phone.  The 5/5s is just perfect size for one hand use and for my pocket.  This is the only reason I am holding off on a new iPhone.
75,"I suspect people that want a smaller form factor will be told to get the watch. *Maybe* we'll see another 4"", but I'm not convinced."
76,Please let this be true.
77,"Hopefully this would take the place of the 16GB model as ""the one we sell for cheap to poor people without letting it eat into our sales of more expensive phones to rich people"""
78,"Oh you mean their game plan all along was to only offer the larger sizes with new design and features this year and then update the smaller model next? Wow crazy, it's like Apple wants people to spend more money or something. 

I just think the wording is funny. ""Considering"" like no doy. "
79,I just miss having the power button on top. 
80,"god this needs to come out like a month before my current plan expires!

I'd love to keep the same size and just upgrade my chipset"
81,"Too many skews. This happened after Jobs left the first time. 
"
82,I love the size of my iPhone 6 plus 
83,"Awesome, I want a phone, not a tablet."
84,iPhone 6s - ?
85,Why do people listen to these stupid ass rumors?
86,iPhone 6 is plenty small and useable in one hand unless you're like Verne Troyer or something.
87,"Please.  The 6 and 6+ are far too big for normal use, and they don't fit in existing accessories."
88,"This is great and all, but I feel like the current spike in iPhone 6 sales is because of the new sizes. I'm sure some people still prefer the smaller size but I don't think the majority do. However, it's good to cover all of their bases releasing the different sizes. "
89,"Words cannot describe how disappointed I am with the 6. I have not found a single improvement that ACTUALLY makes the phone ""good"". Not to mention all the issues that it has.

And I'm coming straight from a 4s."
90,Anything bigger than the iPhone 6 is too big for being a phone.
91,"They had fucking better if they plan on getting my money ever again. I don't want a big, fumbly phone to strain my thumb with. In use my device constantly and have actually had ""mommy thumb"" a condition similar to carpal tunnel from using an oversized android phone."
92,"I like my 6 but I really kind of miss my 5s. It's amazing to think about all the technology packed in to that small package. The 5s has a great camera and still tops most benchmarks, just below the 6 and the 6 plus. "
93,"If Apple is going to offer an iPhone with a 4 inch screen but they aren't going to give it the faster processors of the six then they need to market it as what it is. The 4S Classic.  Not the 6s mini. I know I had three solid years with my 4S that sealed my relationship with Apple. 

It's sort of like when Jeep offered the Cherokee classic. They were able to offer an established product for several more years because of that marketing technique. 

Or like when Coke offered Coke classic. 

My 6+ has a plethora of problems. Shoot I'd be on board with a 4S or a 5S with thumbprint recognition and superfast processors."
94,The normal 6 is perfect sized. This is the biggest waste of time.. while they could be improving the things they already have. Like their terrible OS features. 
95,Uh... no.
96,"I'm curious to know when the phone sizes will start to shift to smaller and smaller, ala a device seen in the movie Her. "
97,Praise the lord!
98,"YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

Always get the S version of iPhones! They refine the technology from the previous models"
99,"Nahhhhhhh.



The normal 6 is plenty small."
100,[deleted]
101,This sounds like an Onion headline
102,"If they were to reduce the side bezels to the thinnest possible, and reduce the top bezel (all space around the speaker and front facing camera) to about half its current size -


.. a 4"" iPhone 6 ""Mini"" could be very, very very small while retaining the 4"" screen."
103,[deleted]
104,"Wait, I thought 3.5"" was ""perfect""?"
105,***
106,"iPhone 6s minus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s plus"
107,Yep. Don't plan on buying an iPhone with a different form factor. Unless my hand grows to Groot-like proportions in the next year.
108,"A new low-spec iPhone would cause a world of pain for iOS game developers - we're so happy that the iPhone 4 is finally dead and buried, and we can focus on making games that run well and look great on the 5 and above, with the 4S dropping into 'minimum spec - it'll run but not great' territory..."
109,"They could stick an A8 in an iPhone mini and probably have it perform similarly to an A9-powered 4.7"" iPhone."
110,"That's what I said after my first android... 
  
My 5c is soooo comfy..."
111,"Agreed, it's just the perfect size. Not too big that it's unwieldy going about your day but not too small that not much of your content is shown onscreen/content is shown in too small a size. "
112,"I have a 6 which is already too big for me to use one handed. Tried the 6 Plus in an Apple Store. Man, I wish I'd gone for that one... I don't have a tablet so the 6 Plus would be a perfect middle ground for that. Oh well."
113,[deleted]
114,"I got a 6 recently and I love it too,but I keep my 4s around for a few small things "
115,"I've played with the various sizes of 6. 

I have little hands. My 5s is as big as I can go and still use it one handed. And that's stretching my thumb reach to its limit for stuff in the top corners. They can keep a small option for people with little hands. "
116,The two aren't mutually exclusive. Working on one doesn't take away from the other.
117,the latter should take care of the former
118,Do you really have significant problems with battery drain? The only people I hear complaining about battery life are my Android friends (regardless of age of the phone) or people with iPhones older than 2-3 years. 
119,It's not like their hardware team is also the software team. 
120,I don't know the battery is pretty alright. Gets about a day. Way better than android. Charges pretty fast too 
121,"since upgrading from the 4 to the 6, I've noticed typing on the phone is less accurate."
122,"I was one of the angry ones, not because of the idea of ""best"" but because I wasn't given the option to keep my version of best. 

I HAVE TINY HANDS. THE 6 IS TOO BIG FOR ME TO GRIP."
123,if you have Verizon then having VoLTE is the main reason to switch.....
124,How's your battery life? Because mine sucks and that makes me want to get a new one. 
125,"They'll soon realise folk like me want a 'classic' size iphone and an iPad. 

If the only option in the future is a huge phone, then I'll have that and no ipad.

They're going to have to come up with some pretty good excuses in the future why plus size future models can't be iPad app compatible."
126,If my 5S had NFC I would be set. 
127,"I hope they do come out with a smaller version. It's not as enjoyable or practical to use a phone with 2 hands for me, I like using the 1 hand."
128,"Yeah I have a 5s and don't see any reason to upgrade either. I like the larger screen of the 6 but it's not enough to make me switch. Hoping for a lot of camera improvements on the 6s, that's the only thing that would make me upgrade."
129,Saw a woman in a pizza shop the other day with a 6 Plus making a phone call and she had to use both hands to hold the fucking thing to her face.
130,"yeah the bezels are huuuge.



[Look at the LG G3 compared to the 6 Plus.
](http://i.imgur.com/DbVIpj0.jpg)

Both of them have 5.5"" screens."
131,"iPhone 6s throwback edition 3.5"" "
132,"The 4s was 3.5""

Now that I have a 6+ (Which is perfect BTW and feels totally natural once you get used to it) My 4s feels like a toy phone in my hands."
133,"I actually really like that size for the feel, but the UI no longer supports it well. You can get, like, 1 sms message on the screen with a keyboard up. If that."
134,I'm okay with this.
135,"there's no reason in calling the 6+ ""pro"".

it's the same phone as the 6, jut bigger.

""pro"" is reserved for devices with significant performance improvements."
136,"This should be top fucking comment, at least with names. Prices, I don't care, but I'm seeing a Scully Sugar Water Pepsi Model line up these days with iPad especially. iPad 2 Mini 2, iPad (not 1 but 4) I don't even know.

If I (who posts to the r/appley subs) can't rememberer, pretty damn sure there's some naming confusion.

Need to whittle that shit down, mate.

"
137,[deleted]
138,"That works. It's simple, and to the point. 

I like Mini. Ties into their product line better. "
139,"I like that, too. Would not hurt to get an iPhone Mini for free."
140,They'd cannibalize their high end sales when casual buyers see the smaller phone that looks like an iPhone for much less. Considering this year's sales are so high I don't think they'd do it.
141,Too close to Samsung.
142,"the word ""pro"" is reserved for the MBP because it has significantly more sheer power compared to the normal one. it has nothing to do with sizes.

and if you look at the actual MB lineup, you'll see the air (light and low powered), MB standard for average use and MB PRO for professional use (who ever needs a quad-core to facebook??)

so calling an iPhone 6 PRO or a MB Mini has no sense whatsoever because the iPhone 6 and 6+ has the same processor."
143,"I think it depends on how often the user watches movies, read books and play games. They are what gives 6+ a big edge. But I get how some people think 5s is easier to use, to type with, to handle, and to put into the pocket."
144,"I'd say it's much more a difference in necessity and/or taste than ""hate"".  Do I understand why someone would want a phone that big?  Absolutely..  but personally, I don't want to have to remove my phone from my pocket before I sit down or have to sit my coffee down to type out a Google search."
145,"If you find a deal on a 4S, it could tide you over until the next model. Then you can resell it for not much loss. If you're willing to ""rent"" a phone for about $50 for the better part of a year, that might work well. I did that when my 3GS broke a month before my upgrade window opened. Bought a 3G for $100, sold it awhile later for $80."
146,SKUs
147,How is there too many? There is only 3 and they are all considerably different from one another and appeal to different people. 
148,Um there are currently 3 iPhones. Having them match better wouldn't be a bad thing. 
149,"You realize there would be literally exactly as many but with the trailing ""free"" iPhone maybe possibly having updated internals? 

Doesn't seem like anything to freak out about. "
150,"I have a 6 and I do find it a strain sometimes to reach the full screen. My wrists get sore if I use alien blue, for example, with one hand for very long. 
   "
151,"um so what's wrong with it?  i went from 4s to 6 plus, took a while to get used to the size but now the 4s looks like a kids toy.  6+ has completely replaced my ipad, it's much easier to type on, the battery life is great, the camera is amazing, etc "
152,I haven't noticed anything except its quicker and the home button is obviously way better and works differently.  Other than that the only difference I see is that I had to pick and choose my Cydia apps differently.
153,You're assuming the mini will have a lower resolution AND that the A9 will be clocked the same across all platforms.
154,Out of anger and regret? I would have also.
155,It is.
156,"""minus"" has a bad taste on the tongue.  Marketing wouldn't allow that terminology. But I like how you think"
157,"iPhone 6s Mini, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Mega"
158,"I have a 6 plus, I jokingly call my friends' phones 6 minus haha. "
159,"Now just need to kill the ipad 2/iPad Mini. Though that would be kind of a dick move from Apple, given that they are/were selling the Mini less than a year ago."
160,"Low performance would be fine for professionals who don't play games, especially if it also means longer battery life."
161,[deleted]
162,"Yep. Bought a 6 and returned it. 5S feels waaaay better in my hand. Looks better too.

"
163,"You have 30 days to change your mind, fyi

Edit: 14. My bad"
164,[deleted]
165,Yea im going for a 6 plus in a few days. And Im convinced I won't like 4.7s after I get used to it.  
166,[deleted]
167,"> The two aren't mutually exclusive. 

Do you honestly think r&d is free or something?  In terms of time **or** money?  Of course working on one takes away from the other.  What confusion of ideas would lead you to think otherwise?

Apple clearly decided with the 6/6+ development to focus on size since Samsung was focusing most of their marketing on humiliating Apple in that regard.  They should have ignored that noise and pushed for... really just about anything else.  You hear this constantly from Apple users: we don't want bigger, thinner phones, we want phones that last longer, hold more data, and don't go to shit every time there is a new OS update.

I've not heard once -- not once -- an iOS user in my presence say ""gee, I wish this phone was bigger"".  I'm sure there are people out there who definitely *do* and *did* want a bigger phone, but there are more important issues and Apple chose to ignore them or at least de-emphasize them this time around.  Worse than that, what I **have** heard lately is people saying ""this phone is too god damned big"".

If I wanted a ridiculous, giant phablet I would have bought a Samsung."
168,Yea fuckin Greg wtf
169,I've had my iPhone less than a year and I definitely have battery drain problems. I always have with my iPhones.
170,"I have an iPhone 5C for work and the thing barely lasts me a day. I turned off everything I don't need to try to help (GPS, Bluetooth, etc.).  Ended up just getting one of those cases with a huge battery in it."
171,"It's not about battery *issues*, they should JUST STOP MAKING THE PHONES THINNER AND THINER AND NOT GIVING THEM MORE BATTERY

Seriously. They made the iPhone 6 so thin that it wiggles when it's put on a flat surface ffs"
172,"I have a 4S and it easily lasts me through the day with moderate/heavy use and will last well into the next with light use.

If I install the Facebook app, that turns into a few hours of moderate/heavy use, and if I'm lucky a work-day of light use."
173,since I've installed ios 8.1.2 my iphone 6 can't go past 6 hours usage time. Not sure if its software or a battery problem :(
174,"5s user here. I take my phone off the charger in the morning before leaving for work - after some light Whatsapp and reddit browsing during my ~30 minute commute, checking emails and Facebook before lunch and maybe a couple of short phone calls, my battery is already well below the 50% mark by lunch time. I'll usually remember to plug it in after lunch to charge again for the evening, but by the time I go to bed it's usually almost dead again.

I definitely feel tied to the charger, and get very anxious if I leave home without one."
175,I've had my 5S since March and the battery is the worst of any iPhone I've owned. 
176,My wife has a 5s and her phone has battery drain problems and there is nothing wrong with the phone.
177,"No battery issues here (Nexus 7 2013, Kitkat), but from what I heard, Lollipop has problems with memory management."
178,It depends entirely on what android phone you're talking about. My One M8 lasts longer than any phone I've ever owned and I've had three generations of iPhone and two androids. 
179,"Some of my Android-using coworkers are pretty jealous of the iPhone's battery life and really sweet camera. They also call me a traitor, since I'm an Android developer. :)"

181,"most of the ladies i know agree with this, they're really boning themselves over by essentially selling the equivalent of the 15 and 17in macbook pros... with no 13in. 

all the same complaints happened when the retina macbook pro only came in 15in though, and then less than a year later we got the 13in.

i think there will at least be a 6c in the 4in size. "
182,Get the leather case and you can grip the 6 no problem.
183,Voice is no longer an essential feature for phones.
184,I didn't realizer this was supported or not on either the 5S or 6. I guess that could be a reason. 
185,But won't it probably come to the 5S eventually?

187,"because ipads have 4:3 screens and iphones have 16:9 screens. 

they're moving towards true resolution independence with the stuff they're pushing devs to do with the current models, but it's not like we're there yet. and encouraging ""universal"" apps would really put a hurt on what makes ipad apps really good in the first place. 

encouraging ""plus"" phone optimized apps that have added functionality is a good idea, though. they should really do that. "

198,Yeah but then nobody would get the bigger ones

I have a 6+, and while it took a week or so to get used to the size, there is no going back for me. The complaints about size are so counter to everything I've experienced, I was convinced for a while that they were all Samsung trolls. I guess I understand that everyone is different, but I just don't understand the hate."
205,"I do have a nagging feeling that I've paid out nearly £600 for a better home button... seriously, Touch ID is the only thing that really seperates the 6 from my old 4s for me.

Then again, I don't really take that many photos. And if I'm honest, now that more of the apps I use have gone native, I am enjoying the phone a little more. Up until now though, thoroughly meh."

207,iPhone 6s Fun Size?
208,How about iPhone 6c? They might just chose to go for a rebranding of an existing product. 
209,"The iPad 2 (and Mini 1) are similar in performance to the 4S, just with a slightly higher respolution.

The real problem device is the iPad 3 - with it's 3 million pixel retina display (remember that 1080p is only 2 million pixels), without enough of an increase in GPU power to make use of those pixels..."
210,"Well, Apple doesn't let developers set minimum device specs, just a minimum iOS version. And some of us are working on fairly high-end 3D games that simply won't work on older devices.

Prior to iOS8, we *had* to support iPhone 4. This device was a problem, as it was the first to have the retina screen, and has a very low level of GPU power per pixel. (The 4S had about 6x the GPU power, I believe - so was a big step forward for gaming)

But now iOS8 is out, we can require iOS8 for our games, and finally not have to deal with the 4!

(Yeah, if you're just using it for a phone and basic apps, and aren't too impatient, the 4 is probably still fine - so long as it's had the battery replaced - but you're not going to have a good time trying to play higher-end games on it!)"
211,I was android all the way until the 6. Never truly like iPhones until the 6 came out. To each his own.
212,5S is better for apps in general. But 6+ wipes its ass when it comes to watching movies or reading ebooks.
213,agreed. 5S all the way!
214,Same here. Love this size and style. 
215,Small hands? I have quite a medium sized pair of hands and was pleasantly surprised how comfortable iPhone 6 looked in my hand.. I am totally a one hand usage guy and I loved it.
216,"As someone with a 6 plus... Nope. I can't imagine going back to that size. It is comfortable, but this screen is amazing! However I use my phone with two hands most of the time anyways, so there's that! "

223,">I've not heard once -- not once -- an iOS user in my presence say ""gee, I wish this phone was bigger"". 

Don't you think Apple did poll research on this? Seriously man? Android is the biggest competitor and those phones are all big.

As for R&D money, Apple has a virtually endless supply. If they want to make a change to their product that results in a significant sales increase they will do it. Working on battery longevity doesn't take away from form factor research and vice versa."
224,"I disagree with you. I like my 6 plus, I don't want to pay extra for storage because I can get free space a number of ways, and I didn't think my 5 went to shit every time an update was released. 

I'm not saying it is wrong to like small phones or lots of storage; I'm just saying there are users who don't want those things. "
225,"As much as he is being downvoted, and no matter how much money Apple has, he's correct about one taking away from the other. It's not like Apple ploughs all their money back into the company like a firm such as Amazon. Granted it's not like Apple can't accomplish both at once. "

227,Check Battery Usage at Settings app - it'll tell you which apps are draining your phone. Either remove them or turn off their permission to run in the background.
228,"Part of it is that earlier iPhones had much superior battery life, especially compared to android.  The other part is bad settings due to iOS upgrades. "
229,Sounds like that's a you problem and not an iPhone problem. 
230,"Weird. I've had some issues, but that's towards the 2 year mark and a battery recalibration usually fixes the issue. Do you have Background App Refresh on for a lot of apps?

Also - thanks to whoever downvoted me for disagreeing with me! :D"
231,The 5C should last barely a day at best. 
232,"I had a 5 that I did fine with, but my wife struggles to get through the day with the 5c. I upgraded to the 6 now, almost never have an issue getting through the day."
233,"They made it thinner, but didn't they flatten it out and actually increase the percentage of space taken up by the battery?"
234,Seems like a crapshoot from everyone's testimonies! :/
235,"6 to 7 hours of screen on time is fairly typical for an iPhone. I've had my iPhone screen on for 3 hours and 17 minutes and my battery is sitting at 51%. 

Note that I'm referring to screen on time and NOT usage time. Usage includes things like background usage and music playback. "
236,"something is wrong then, mine will go almost 2 days"
237,"Mine goes about 18 hours of intense use, and close to 36 on light use. "
238,"I'm having this same problem but since iOS 8.1, I used to get 2 days solid use from the phone now I'm lucky to get 8 hours usage with it, I took it in to apple they said wipe the phone and don't restore from iCloud and it still hasn't helped, my advice is to go back in."
239,"Probably the OS is more resource intensive. You can try turning off features, but I doubt it'll help much.

You figured they would ensure their OS is resource efficient, but I wonder if advances in hardware are allowing companies to spend less time on that and more time on feature development. I heard, generally at Apple, that their engineering teams are slightly understaffed, so I wouldn't be shocked if stuff is getting a little less attention than it deserves. :/"
240,Mine lasts most of the day for me (6AM-7PM) with Facebook installed and background refresh on for like everything. Try auto brightness. It's amazing. 
241,"depends on the phone you're using, android is on thousands of phones &#3232;_&#3232;"

243,We truly live in the future!
244,"Pretty sure that IS essential to what makes a phone a phone... How the voice comms work, maybe not..."
245,The iPhone 5 and 5S do not support voice and data at the same time due to the CDMA and LTE chip being some hybrid nonsense that can't use both antennas at the same time. The 6 and 6+ support VoLTE so it finally can handle the dual pipe! 
246,It wouldn't be capable of it? That's why you'd have to upgrade. 
247,It cannot. It is hardware unfortunately. I was hoping the same before I upgraded 
248,Yeah well my 5s is worse than my 4 was. Even at the end of its life. 
249,The battery life on the 6 actually is better than the 5s. Not by leaps and bounds but it is an improvement. 
250,I'd have thought with iPad mini and two sizes of iphone already they'd carry on with a smaller phone.

256,Do you use your MacBook in the air with one hand?
257,"But the camera isn't better. It has OIS but that's very debatable how noticeable that even is under most conditions. The processor might be slightly faster but every benchmark I've seen has the 6 running as fast or faster. 

They could make changes next year but for now the only major difference is screen size and battery size.  "
258,Stop! That's too many!
259,5'10. 
260,"Well said. Couldn't go back to a smaller phone either.

But I do know quite a few people who prefer the 5s size. Makes sense to have something to cover all bases. "
261,Not even close physically to the size of an iPad or a Nexus 9. And the iPhone 6+ is still taller than a Nexus 6 with a smaller screen.

we're not going to get a metal 4in phone, but i would be completely unsurprised to see a seriously updated 5c-type chassis(maybe with rounded sides, etc) with an A8 and the fingerprint scanner. "
269,"Yea, I play a lot of games and watch a lot of videos on my phone, so the 4.7 inch screen is a godsend compared to the 3.5 inch screen on a 4S."
270,"I hopped over to a Note 3  for the screen size and the chance to experiment with Android... I said in September that I'd consider going back if the 6 was 5.5"".... well, now I probably will switch back. Big screens are great for showing people my video showreels when I meet them at random."
271,"i've used both a lot. Had almost every iphone, and a bunch of android phones from stuff *smaller* than 3.5 like the G1/dream, to big old gigantic slabs like the G3 with 6+ sized screens. After using a bunch of larger phones the 5/5s felt *tiny*, but the 6+ felt too big.

After playing around with a 6 for a minute, i was completely sold on this being the one phone i'd be fine with using for at least a year, if not longer. "
272,"I don't do either of those things on my phone, but I can definitely see how that would be the case.
"
273,"Not who you were responding to, but that's why I don't want a 6. I have average sized hands, but I'm still a chick, so they're average sized chick hands."

278,There's nothing wrong with Messenger. That's actually a solid app. Just don't enable background refresh for it. It's Facebook that's the culprit. That app and the website are one of the biggest clusterfucks in programming ever. One day CS professors are going to use them as examples of what not to do when making a website.
279,"I've been running the most current releases of iOS on a 4S since early 2012. I mainly use iMessage, Twitter, camera, AlienBlue, Safari, and Reeder. I've never downloaded Facebook or their message app. To this day I am amazed at the life of a single battery charge. Keep crap off your phone and your phone won't give you crap. "
280,I also close all the background apps. You're right though; Facebook apps are battery vampires. 
281,"I agree. Did some experiments on it on my 4s and 5s, battery life improved significantly after I removed the Facebook app (I kept the Messenger app as I don't find that makes any difference if any at all). 

Background: I turned off Background App Refresh, Notifications, Location, everything I could find for Facebook app, and I usually just check Facebook app once a day, and force quit it from app switcher afterwards. "
282,Do you have an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus?
283,I keep my brightness pretty much all the way down and I don't have FB or messenger installed. 
284,"My wife who has like the tiniest hands ever can one hand my 6 without issue. It's a dexterity problem, not a hand size one. Some people just have shitty coordination."
285,There is absolutely no reason it can't support it. All the new VoLTE phones have is one less CDMA radio. Its simply a matter of updating the baseband to support it. 
286,Depends on your usage. If you have a lot of standby then it will be better because at that point it just comes down to absolute battery size. If you use it a lot the larger screen usurps the benefit of the larger battery and basically makes it a wash. In tests with full screen time (like gsm arena's browsing test where the screen is on for the entire duration) the 5s actually beats the 6.
287,The iPad mini isn't a phone. Take tablets out of the equation.

The other drive is in fact a 2.5 5400rpm HDD however.

Regardless the heat issue is unacceptable, which is probably the cause for it being so sluggish, the way this thing sounds it must be thermal throttling.

*Edited to fix misrepresentation.

After looking at some tear downs, the only fans it has are the 1 on the GPU and another on the Processor that's being used to funnel to a radiator to passively cool."
365,Exactly my story. My friend wants to buy a MSI nightblade MI3.  With those specs
366,"Yep, she must be the overcontrolling, all knowing and respecmahautoreteh kind of parent. Horrible. "
367,Live and learn.
368,"I agree prebuilts are shit but don't hate on the sff mitx matx builds

just because something is small doesn't mean it will have thermal issues and perform very poorly.


this is almost always a symptom of prebuilts from OEMs, they cheap out on certain things and don't care about the product, where as building your own is almost always going to guarantee better (or at worst the same) performance when compared to a prebuilt.

I exclusively build matx and mitx or sff, of course cooling will be an issue but I've never had anything happen like what happened to your [friend!] (https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/9lk6va/got_a_prebuilt_but_it_sucks_need_help/)
"
369,Why does this make me so furious
370,His mother's a restrictive coward.
371,"If something breaks he gets a new system, that's basically a laptop"
372,"Well, it's broken and he has to send it back for a refund. I guess her idea kinda worked in a twisted way."
373,"The irony is, the pre-built has a much shorter warranty of probably only 1 year versus upwards of 10 years for individually-purchased components."
374,"Isn't the pre-built sucking the equivalent to ""What if something doesn't work and you have to send it back?""

Like with that performance I'd send it back"
375,That is a shame. That wouldn’t happen to me because it’s all about the experience 
376,"Please stop him from doing that as well holy fuck lmao, but yeah, getting a big case or one with plenty of room is the best idea IMO. Lian Li Dynamic 011 is currently one of the best IMO, I'm new to building and have built in a P350x and Meshify C, both have their own small problems and I think getting a case with lots of room is best as a new builder or if you want no hassle. No worrying about if fans will fit, no worries about GPU length or CPU cooler length or Radiator compatibility and best of all, no worries about cable management.

My next build will 100% be a Lian Li or a case with more room than I need so I don't have to struggle with cable management or fitting. My move from Meshify C to P350x made me lose a top fan since the plug for the CPU power blocked the 2nd LL140 I had at the top. And I had to move from the Meshify C because the GPU length was too restricting.

If he just wants it for gaming, don't let that poor soul go i9. 2080ti isn't great price/performance wise but a super beefy card."
377,"If your friend can't tell you \*specifically\* why he \*needs\* an i9 processor, don't fucking let him get it! Unless you're absolutely CRUSHING your CPU with work, all cores 100%, you do NOT need an i9! It is wasted money and power.

&#x200B;

2080ti is likely overkill as well unless they want to go straight for something nuts like 1440p 144hz.

&#x200B;

Teach your friend how to match a build to its task. The money saved will buy some sweet peripherals like a force feedback racing wheel or a quality HOTAS."
378,getting a i9 for gaming would be just as dumb as getting a pre built. 
379,I understand she is the mother and all but... Why exactly she can take decisions over a topic she has no idea about? When i was a minor my parents had the decency to realize that i know what I'm doing. 
380,That mother is full of bs
381,"Who paid for it?  If it was me I wouldn't have said nothin' and stockpiled the parts at a friends' place and brought it home when it was built, but really, parents like this are ridic."
382,Oh that's even worse lol
383,"Alot trickier to build. Youve got less space, much more complicated cooling and limited upgradability. definitely not for someones first ever pc build."
384,"Heat, difficulty in building/upgrading, more expensive for itx"
385,Hey honestly you can upgrade your system by moving it into a better case with fans and you'd fix a ton of problems on the cheap without changing your gpu or cpu. Some of those parts in the pre build can be used again on another build.
386,I suggest grabbing a bar stool first and climbing on top. 
387,"you should have a look at what his temps are, and where he has it set up.  
  
also look though his Bios and make sure the OS is on the correct drive.  
  
also make sure it's plugged in correctly, the HDMI out on the mother board should not be the one used."
388,"With a 144Hz display, what games can a 1050 run at 144fps? Lol & dota?"
389,That's so frustrating to hear. PC gaming is one of those things where you can really express yourself and dive into without people judging you. Let that kid be a kid!
390,"That's fair, SFF Can be great, which is why I specified sff prebuilts.

I've seen some great sff systems, this one, was not one of them."
391,You're telling me! Would have been a way better rig and a killer afternoon with a bro but instead he's stuck with a sub par overpriced sff he hates.
392,What GPU do you have?  I have an ROG Strix 1080ti in my Meshify C white.  Fits no problem.  Were you running a rad on the front?
393,"I'm using a P350X myself, absolutely love it, I just used 120mm at the top (the case included a 120mm at the back and I already had a good 120mm so i just moved the included one to the top).

But yeah, don't worry, i'm going to be building and budgeting for him, not letting him get an i9 but he really wants the best of the best in graphics so he might make me get him the 2080ti lmao.

It's his money :P"
394,"Oh yeah no, don't worry, I won't let him do it."
395,"Eh.  With i9 becoming the new i7 in the 9th gen it isn't that big of a waste.  

The 2080ti is a bit of a waste.  But I doubt a person who just bought a PC will be upgrading within the time while that is still relevant.  The 2180ti or 2280ti will likely be out by that time and will hopefully be worth buying once the RTX tax dies down.  


I will never understand somebody saying you shouldn't go with the better parts if you can.  

I have a 7700k.  I still wish I had a faster CPU all the time. 

I have 32gb of ram.  I regret not getting 64gb at times.  

I have a 1080ti.  Some games still bring it to it's knees.

At the time I built my pc people tried to talk me into an i5,  1070 and 16gb of ram,  saying it was enough and I was wasting my money. 

I'm glad I didn't listen to them.

The demand of games is outpacing performance improvements.  There isn't a single machine out there that is complete ""overkill"" for gaming.  There is always a game out there that can take far more than you can provide it.  "
396,"She went half + Paid for Tax and shipping.

But yeah I agree, ridic.

Even without going half we could have built an identical or even *better* system with a Ryzen and RX 580

397,"I still remember when ASUS wanted to cramp so much components on it's itx board that eventually they created a daughter board for it, with m.2 slot and sound chipset."

400,The smaller your rig the bigger your d***
401,how is SFF more expensive? ITX boards and cases are usually at least a little bit cheaper.
402,"I was actually googling around earlier and yeah it totally has a full size graphics card in it.

406,"oh yeah esp if it's MSI, great motherboards, nice looking high end GPUs

But dear god their choice of thermal solutions and paste is like they tolda 2 year old to pick which one tasted the best"
407,:(
408,Yea I built my first pc about a year ago and my mom and dad at first were the exact same way but eventually they said if anything happens your out all of your money but I also had a friend who has done it before so like he said learn from failure
409,Can't he just return the prebuilt?
410,Yeah. Prefer AIOs so I can actually change stuff without needing to take the CPU cooler off. Plus not a fan of how they install 
411,So he's effectively just wasted $1300?..
412,"Yeah, If I was on someone elses money I'd have a 2080 at the moment but when I went to put the 2080 in my cart and pay I couldn't help but have anxiety, if DLSS and Ray-tracing is promising I will pull the trigger but at the moment, damn."

416,What?  I can get a decent b350 atx board for like $75 and the cheapest itx I can find is like $120 lol.  That's a heavy premium for less fucking shit on the board.
417,230w?! Wow.
418,"Pretty much yeah.

Not his choice so it was either the $1300 prebuilt or nothing.

420,"I mean, if your metric is dirt cheap shitty AMD boards, you can find those in ITX flavors at the same price."
421,"One thing to note, a lot of itx motherboards have wifi built-in.  Which makes sense -- they don't have an open slot to add one later, and the use case for these systems often require wifi anyway.  But if you don't need wifi, you're paying extra for a feature you don't need.

For price comparison, the ASRock B350 itx board is $108, while their equivalent atx board is $81.  That $27 difference is roughly what you'd pay for an equivalent WIFI card.  And the ITX has a better audio solution (appropriate for the HTPC market, of course).

Don't get me wrong: there's still a price premium for itx, but it's not in the motherboard.   No, the biggest problem is that there's less competition for components that are compatible in small form factors, so the prices for things that are compatible are a bit higher.  So you might not be able to fit the cheaper power supply/graphics card/CPU cooler/HDD/etc. in the case and have to go with the more expensive option.

Oh, and there are a lot of premium itx cases out there, too, which drives up cost a lot.  But budget itx cases can be found for not much more than a simple atx case."
422,"Well considering you have to pay attention to the VRM configuration of those boards, the ASRock Fatal1ty B450 GAMING-ITX/AC has a 6+2 configuration and is $120. That's better than majority of more expensive full sized ATX boards while still satisfying a small size."
423,"SO-DIMM Memory as well, which is shockingly not soldered to the motherboard and can just be swapped out."
424,"I wouldn't call her a shithead since she did still drop $1300 on a gaming device for her kid.  I'd have been lucky growing up to get even half of that from my parents to spend on a PC.

Is there any reason it had to be a small form factor PC?  There are still some decent prebuilts out there, but I've never seen a custom PC the size of a PS4 be anything other than a thermal nightmare with hugely overpriced.  "
425,Lol yea she only bought him a 1300 pc. Fuck her right. Normally parents do know better than kids and it’s usually the kids that always think they are right.
426,"I beg to differ about temps, at least GPU wise (unless you’re running a hybrid unit)"
427,"I'd scratch the B350 board out of the comparison though because most require a BIOS update to support Ryzen 2 and in order to do that BIOS update, you need to put in a Ryzen 1 CPU just to get it to boot using a Ryzen 2 CPU. 

Furthermore, you have to pay attention to the VRM configuration of these boards. You can't just find an ""equivalent"" ATX board for $81 and think it'll perform the same. I'll take a 6+2 configuration on an ITX board over a $81 budget board. Weak VRM configurations won't allow the CPUs to properly overclock or maintain that higher clock speed since they'll overheat or won't provide the power necessary. 

I agree that there's a price difference for ITX boards but ultimately you're getting a decked out board that's still within the same price range as even the most expensive full ATX board of the equivalent chipset."
428,"Sure but have you built in a budget ITX case?  They have awful layouts and are difficult to work in.  I built one for my wife to use with the TV and you have to slide the power supply out just to get to the motherboard because I bought a cheapo thinking it would be good enough.  A cheap ATX case though is pretty much still a normal atx layout and workable the same way.  

you can go budget ATX, but budget ITX is a pain in the ass."
429,So it is basicly a laptop
430,"Well, you definitely live and learn man."
431,"That's fair, shithead is a bit too strong, my apologies.

Perhaps, stubborn, would be more appropriate.

I'm pretty sure she wanted it to be an SFF for the only reasons anyone would want an SFF, they're small, low profile, and portable.

432,"> That's fair, shithead is a bit too strong, my apologies.

"
433,"Gamer’s Nexus proved that GPU temps in the H200i are dependent on the size of the PSU. An SFX PSU was essential in the H200i to take full advantage of the perforated power supply shroud’s extra airflow.

With that in mind, it’s a great little case."
434,"> I'd scratch the B350 board out of the comparison though because most require a BIOS update to support Ryzen 2 and in order to do that BIOS update, you need to put in a Ryzen 1 CPU just to get it to boot using a Ryzen 2 CPU.

That's only true if the board has been sitting in inventory for a while.  Supposedly most boards you buy now have the BIOS update anyway.  Though the same analysis applies to the B450 boards.  The difference would only be $19, actually.

> Furthermore, you have to pay attention to the VRM configuration of these boards. You can't just find an ""equivalent"" ATX board for $81 and think it'll perform the same.

Weak VRM configurations won't allow the CPUs to properly overclock or maintain that higher clock speed since they'll overheat or won't provide the power necessary.

True enough, though I chose to compare against the Gaming K4 instead of the cheaper Pro4 just for that reason.  The Gaming K4 actually has a 6+3 phase design (though with all the shenanigans going on with VRM marketing, I have no idea how that actually compares to anything else).

> I agree that there's a price difference for ITX boards but ultimately you're getting a decked out board that's still within the same price range as even the most expensive full ATX board of the equivalent chipset.

Yeah, that's the point, in the end.  ITX motherboards aren't extra expensive, they're just premium motherboards to begin with.  Build an ATX system with equivalent quality and specifications and you'll end up at a similar price point.  One reason ATX can be cheaper is because you can find less capable (and therefore less expensive) components."
435,"Yeah pretty much.

A laptop with a full size GPU strapped to it."
436,"It's not the best suggestion, but maybe you can convince her to get him a laptop instead?  Maybe get a nice laptop with a Thunderbolt 3 port and get an external GPU set up instead.

That way, since he's planning on getting a new PC sometime soon, he can just use the laptop for when he goes to college (or whatever) and use the GPU for his next build.

I don't know.. it's a thought.  "
437,Drill some holes in a case?
438,"Mother dearest won't even let him sell old gamecubes he's had sitting in a drawer for years, don't think drilling holes into a $1300 PC would fly either.

At this point i've pretty much told him to keep that fan pointed on it and keep the temperature in his room low until he's in a position where he can upgrade and tamper without a constant pressure monitoring his every action.

He's 17, he'll be outta there soon."

Thanks for the quick response. This is amazing news! 

What do you mean by train the air to the top? if it mount it with the tubes at the bottom of the radiator, will that accomplish the same thing? Or do I need to do something in particular?"
455,"I haven't had that issue, mobo and case are aligned well. Maybe there's something preventing you from screwing the motherboard all the way in? Does the integrated io shield look aligned with the plastic shroud on the mobo?"
456,"I've seen a bunch of MSI motherboards at work and they're frequently like you described. I/O shield slanted and doesn't line up with the case.

If you want, take the motherboard out and look at the I/O shield from the side. You can add washers on the screw points to fix it"
457,Uuuu no. Wanted to route the cables in front because I prefer the look.
458,"I mean just to make sure that there aren't any air gaps in the pump. So with the tubes mounted at the bottom make sure the air is caught at the top of the radiator without the tubes, this prevents the air from getting to the pump. Hope that makes sense!"

520,I think using ExpertRaw + knowing yourself that you can see the Milky Way with your own eyes so I don’t think AI play apart in this one. try to capture the moon with the ExpertRaw I’m sure you will get a different results but sadly using Raw format you can’t use the 100x zoom so you won’t get the picture looking like the AI ONE

525,"Yes it can, but you need a dark night a need to find where the Milky Way located, you can use an app called star chart to look for the Milky Way"
526,Maybe next year. Milky way season here is around april-may and I only got my ultra last month. Will definitely take note of the settings
527,What exact settings did you use? Just raw format?
528,How long of an exposure?  Tripod?
529,I'm guessing you also had the advantage of being somewhere with super low light pollution?
530,Camera>Expert RAW>Astrophoto
531,LEGEND\^
532,Do you mind I download and edit this photo? I love taking photos from this phone and editing them.
533,"Yeah not everything is AI lol.  Looks good man,  must be some seriously dark skies."
534,"New information this from my friends phone I guess the size that i posted on there was from Google photo backup which is not the original

535,i use sequator to stack btw!
536,"take all your photos, send to computer, download sequator or other stacking software, watch tutorial for said software, enjoy output"
537,"I tried expert pro mode as well, result is not close to this unfortunately 😞"
538,Okay yea that makes more sense
539,"yep, got it. thanks man. I just bought this phone a few days ago, haven't explored everything in it"
540,"I've tried ExpertRaw on my S22 Ultra, but not being able to manually select ISO keeps fucking me over. 

What WB setting did you use? I'll give that a go next time skies are clear."
541,Makes me want to buy a new phone hehe
542,Looking forward to see it and make sure that you post it on here too 😀
543,So yes I took it in raw format and set ISO to 800 and speed shutter at 30s and make sure you keep your phone still for 30 second I didn’t have a tripod with me so I put it on a motorbike seat haha
544,30s and I didn’t have tripod with so I just put the phone on motorbike seat
545,"Thanks, make sure you give it a good use. It’s a great phone"
546,"Yes it was a very dark night without disturbing light from anywhere. It is famous tourist spot in Bali not a lot of houses in the area so it was a perfect place. I will show you the picture of where I was during the day

https://preview.redd.it/8jr37a4efp2c1.jpeg?width=3733&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=33350b1743a9c8a2cd59fee4565756734f0834b8"
547,"You know what I didn’t know at that time that the phone having Astrophoto, we were just looking up the sky and saw the Milky Way and that’s it I thought I will give it a try"
548,I don’t mind at all😀
549,Thank you 🙏Definitely it was a very dark sky that night and we could see the Milky Way with a naked eyes so that is when I wanted to try to capture this because if the sky not dark enough it would be very difficult to see the Milky Way.
550,👍
551,May I see what you got? Don’t give up✌️
552,"I was using my friends phone so I wish I can try to figure it out for you. The WB that I use at the time was at 4100k and here is the original picture looks like before I edited with Lightroom mobile

https://preview.redd.it/giqmoh7uoiwb1.jpeg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2ec7f38a00626873c117dd0b093aee9bd13b0589"
553,Pretty amazing makes me want to actually use my phone
554,That's beautiful
555,"Probably about the same result. The way you did it is more difficult I guess, so props to you ;)"
556,"https://preview.redd.it/q1k2syhb6kwb1.jpeg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5e04362a21089257fc8a4afd9e009f8a7c280f8f

After 7 mins lol"
557,Not giving up but I've tried for 10 mins as well. Don't get the same result for some reason. Do you use any specific software? I tried Lightroom but results are never the same
558,"https://preview.redd.it/ppg8fkp87kwb1.jpeg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cbcdc1ab2fae4c9b7d549bb2bbbf4386f997e655

Actual raw version"
559,Thank you *very* much. I'll be giving that a go :)
560,"Thanks, you should add it to your travel destination"
561,🙏😀
562,No I didn’t use any specific software all I did just use the ExpertRaw and set ISO to 800 and 30s speed shutter and did a little bit of editing on Light room and that’s it. I think your picture are great but if you want to try to capture the milky you need to locate where it is by using third party app or use the astrophotograpy that came with the phone which actually I didn’t know that you have that option because it wasn’t my phone that I used.
563,"https://preview.redd.it/80mc15xy0pwb1.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=32e4d6be095a793296b90672a852cf1636017a0e

I took that picture in august so it was a prime time for that but I didn’t actually plan anything. Just looked up the sky and noticed the Milky Way and that is it I gave it a shot.

Read this article it will give you some information about the Milky Way

[https://darksitefinder.com/how-to-see-the-milky-way/#:\~:text=The%20core%20of%20the%20milky,a%20few%20hours%20before%20sunrise](https://darksitefinder.com/how-to-see-the-milky-way/#:~:text=The%20core%20of%20the%20milky,a%20few%20hours%20before%20sunrise)."
564,Good one 👍
565,Try the app called star chart it will help you to locate the Milky Way by just move your phone around but remember the moonlight can have an effect with the Milky Way and I just watch a few videos on YouTube this time of year is not a best time to capture the Milky Way
566,"This site also give date and time that you can try to capture it 

https://capturetheatlas.com/how-to-photograph-the-milky-way/#:~:text=The%20best%20time%20to%20photograph,galactic%20bulge%20is%20not%20visible."
567,Wow loads of preparation from your side instead of just pointing towards the sky and shooting. No wonder it came out this good! Efforts paid off 👌
568,Yeah it’s quite a bit but if you are lucky enough you don’t have to prepared anything just like me. I don’t even have the tripod to hold to hold the phone 😂
569,You are doing it correct now just wait for the time that you can spot the Milky Way and it will look just the same
570,"Consider the Sony ZV-1.  Very portable, great video, and under $700."
571,Another ZV-1 fan. I made significant money doing product photos and videos last year with  a ZV-1. I'd post a clip or a pic if I could.
572,"I get great 4k video from my Lumix FZ-1000, which is basically a point-and-shoot with a 1-inch sensor and a 25-400 equivalent zoom built in.  Won't fit in a pocket, but it is quite light and easy to carry. Very durable, I've dropped it more than once in the 5 years I've had it, and it still works fine.

My DJI Pocket 2 is also very handy and as the name suggests, pocketable. Ultimate pocketability is the DJI Action 2, which I acquired recently.

If the output is too saturated, that's easily fixed in video editing software."
573,I would look into the new Sony Xperia phone. The samples I've seen coming out of that are incredible.
574,I loooove my DJI pocket 2!! This was shot using it 90% of the time. Highly reccommend!! https://youtu.be/qAuUIId1UUo
575,"I was also looking for a niche of size-to-bokeh ratio to film travel videos…

I don’t think anything beats sony a6500 with sony 35mm f/1.8 OSS.  It’s tiny with an almost pancake lens. 4K, great DoF, Stabilization in body and lens.  Slim enough for a cargo pocket - I’m pretty sure LxW is smaller than my iPhone mini

Other options would be sigma fp or black magic.. but no IBIS + they need to be kitted out to be bulky"
576,"with half of your $1200 budget, a used A6300 for $600 would trash all your suggestions if you can work around the overheating in 4k after 40-50min continuous 4k recording.

a6400 if you want something new within that budget without overheating limits.  


The iphone doesnt beat any of the cameras you mentioned."
577,"Sony RX0 Mk II. Way smaller than an iPhone, but has a full 1"" sensor. In proper lighting, it looks just as good as my $3,000+ Alpha cameras, and you can grab one used for around $500. The battery life sucks, but you can add a micro USB power adapter and run it all day without problems. It also has HDMI out which is freaking MINT. My secret weapon when I need a bunch of other angles for cheap, but holds up for professional use."
578,"My choice for this is the Blackmagic pocket cinema camera original with a pancake lens at 16mm. It's color is perfect, but battery life sucks, has no ibis, shoots 1080p....yet....i always choose it because the image is another level"
579,"i second the a6000 series, a bit too much maybe but with a small lens its really portable and can fit in a pocket"
580,"Not saying that's the case, but have you personally used a GoPro or just think you don't like the output from what you've seen in the promo vids / YouTube? The 3 settings you're after are bit rate, colour profile, and sharpness, and, you guessed it, the defaults are ""low"", ""gopro"", and ""high"" respectively. Flipping it to high bit rate, flat profile, and no baked in sharpening makes it actually gradeable and I'd argue better than most phones for run and gun street / travel content.

The main weaknesses would be terrible low light and the non replaceable wide angle, but if those aren't breaking weaknesses, it's definitely easy to pocket, doesn't overheat, batteries are small, cheap, and trivial to swap and last about 1h15m a pop, stabilisation is incredibly good, especially if you turn it off and stabilise in post with ReelSteady (gopro records the gyro data as meta, so it's not entirely just crop based), and you can get whatever mounts / accessories you can possibly think of."
581,"There really isn't anything that is legit pocketable with better image quality. The reason phone cameras are worse is because they are smaller. Smaller sensors, smaller lenses. Both of those things just inherently need size. Phone cameras have gotten tricky with processing in the camera that makes them punch way above their weight class. You aren't going to find anything remotely close to an iphone that is remotely as small as it. Things like the Fuji are going to be your best bet and they will beat out the iphone in a lot of scenarios but not significantly."
582,A Sony a6400 with a fast zoom lens will blow a fuckin iPhone out of the water.
583,Sigma fp
584,Black magic pocket 6k?
585,"For pocketable video you just can't beat the iPhone 13 pro or Google pixel 6 pro. The smaller apsc line of camera has been slacking behind their full frame siblings especially for the price you pay new. 

As you've mentioned the ai and computational power from the newest of smart phones is going to land you a better looking video image and be something that you can pocket.

If you really don't want a phone then perhaps the Fujifilm line may offer something. They're currently the only ones offering 10 bit 4k down sampled video in an apsc sensor at an affordable price, especially secondhand. Have a look at the xt30 mk 1 or MK2 and a pancake lens. You might be able to pocket that."
586,The panisonic camera are really nice. Even the gh2 gives very nice 1080. The g85 is pretty good
587,Check out the DJI Pocket 2.
588,"The Sony, Fuji and Ricoh will beat any phone when it comes to raw IQ output."
589,Why are you shooting the videos? Is it for your personal use or do you intend to use the video for more professional purposes?
590,"A go pro can shoot amazing video and is small and relatively cheap. Also very versatile, I would highly recommend looking into that."
591,"I used a GoPro for my video blogs.  Spent a little more for ext mic, mic adapter and a special case to tie it all together.  Takes amazing video and audio"
592,"Sony a6400: $900 on the Sony web site ([https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/interchangeable-lens-cameras/aps-c/p/ilce6400-b](https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/interchangeable-lens-cameras/aps-c/p/ilce6400-b))

There are several lenses at KEH around $300 or less for this camera such as the 35mm f/1.8 OSS: [https://www.keh.com/shop/sony-sel-35f18-35-mm-f-1-8-fixed-focal-length-lens-for-e-mount.html](https://www.keh.com/shop/sony-sel-35f18-35-mm-f-1-8-fixed-focal-length-lens-for-e-mount.html)"
593,"Whatever you end up going with, get a variable ND filter."
594,"As a Song alternative, take a look at the Lumix GX-9."
595,"Get a Z-Cam E1. It's a small MFT camera with 4K - beautiful color science for the size. If you are into editing on your laptop, this is a great option. ~~$700~~  $399 for the camera and an extra $200 - $500 for glass. If you are looking to upload on mobile, stick with a mobile phone but mileage will vary.

https://www.soltyscameras.com/product-page/z-cam-e1"
596,"OP if you haven't looked at the [DJI Pocket 2](https://www.dji.com/uk/pocket-2?site=brandsite&from=nav) yet, I strongly urge you to consider it. It's NOT an action camera and it ticks all your boxes.

It's the only device that gives the iPhone 13 Pro a run for its money in terms of the pocketability requirement and also very much so in the imaging department (There are arguements to be made that it is better than the iPhone 13 Pro as a camera) but it gives you a LOT of versatility that a small compact camera won't.

Better still, the device has it's own internal gimbal so you can also get stabilised shots from it. Also as optional extras, it has a range of accessories such as a stand for blogging support, is tripod mountable when it needs to be, ND filters, etc. Even tricked out with the optional extras it comes in cheaper than a iPhone 13 Pro.

Oh and one big thing it has that will save you some ""storage anxiety"" and that was the clincher for me...unlike the fixed and non expandable memory size of the iPhone, this device takes memory cards. So you always have the peace of mind option of a memory card swap to keep on filming."
597,the sony suggestions amd get an external mic
598,iPhone 13 pro owner here - I shoot a lot of Reels for IG and can’t tell you how impressed I am with the stabilization when shooting in wide angle at 4K/60. Hands down the best pocket sized camera.
599,I like my ZV-1
600,Perhaps one of Canon's mirrorless cameras?
601,Sony Zv1 or canon m6 ii both very good
602,I second this.
603,Isn't it just an inferior rx100 vii?
604,…no one is stopping you…
605,"I've got the original dji pocket it's amazing during the day with good light.

The built in gimbal is really good and works amazing well for motionlapse videos. That's what I mainly got it for."
606,"Just note that this phone advertises a 1-inch sensor but does not actually use most of the sensor due to physical limitations of lens design. They can't get a lens in that chassis depth that projects an image circle big enough. Defeats the purpose IMO and moves it firmly into marketing gimmick land. Philip Bloom tested it against a 13 Pro and you can't really tell the difference - plus it appears to have worse dynamic range than the iPhone as you don't have any computational or multiple exposure video streams being merged.

&#x200B;

If you want something that fits \*in your pocket\*, nothing is going to beat an iPhone 13 Pro at the moment. Kit it out with ND filters and an app that lets you select your shutter speed like Filmic Pro and that's the bleeding edge of what's possible.  They've got industry leading computational photography making it so the image has much higher DR than physics dictates that size of a sensor to have."
607,"I agree. My a6300 + 35mm f/1.8 is the first thing in size that is worth it next to the iPhone 12 pro I have. Sauf, slomo and zoom which would put rx100 also in the group of products that make sense to upgrade from, while still keeping things travel compact enough."
608,35mm is way too tight imo
609,Yes but aren't both those cameras with lenses weighing like half a kilo? And are absolutely not pocketable. Also my budget can go up to 5k+ if there is a thing that conforms to my needs.
610,"The A6300's rolling shutter should immediately disqualify it IMO. It's very, very bad."
611,I see the optics of this comment...
612,"A6300 is still a hell of a camera, pair that up with the new sigma 18-50mm or tamron 17-70mm and your in business. I regret selling mine, those lenses weren’t available when I had mine."
613,"This is the correct answer.

Should be closer to the top."
614,"Yep, own the hero 7 black and insta360 x2, I am yet to see a super quality action camera video, that doesn't have its low bitrate action camera-ness to it (although I am sure a lot of it is youtube compression)."
615,"No shit , and 6400 with something like  FE 28-60mm is 3x times the weight."
616,Pro?
617,"Gh2 body is really cheap now, pair it with a nice 12-35 and you are set."
618,Photos yes. Debatable on video.
619,On the contrary. The ZV-1 is a great camera
620,"No. It's a great little camera. 

If you want something a bit more versatile, any of a6000-series cameras from Sony are great."
621,">it

I have one and it's GREAT, except for battery life, but a good power bank with a great quality Micro USB cable will do, has great zoom, great audio, increidble stabilization, colors look great and natural, gives a good shallow DOF effect.  


All in all, I really like it for 1080p/60 and you can also record in 4k/30 BUT i'd rather go with 1080p for file size."
622,It’s actually a superior rx100vi for video
623,A contract agreement might be.
624,Exactly how much do you think the iphone 13 pro's dynamic range is with the computational videography? I'm talking in terms of stops?
625,that’s probably the best run n gun combo. The iPhone video would get great 24mm-equivalent shots and okay ultra wide-angle. Then the sony gives you 50mm-equivalent
626,">can go up to 5k+ if there is a thing that conforms t

the z ev10 can be somewhat pocketable, even with the colapsible kit lens, will outperform any phone by a massive margin."
627,"There's nothing that's going fit in your pocket and exceed the capability of a 13 Pro no matter how much you spend.

If you can't make this quality work for your needs I would work on other aspects of filmmaking/content creation or go with a device that's not as pocketable.

&#x200B;

Take these as inspiration - you can get some insane imagery out of an iPhone.  Cinematic mode is surprisingly nice when you use it correctly and in the right situation but the regular 24fps 4K with proper ND/shutter speed looks amazing and is absolutely serviceable."
628,Depends on lens and pocket size. Sony make a 20mm and 16mm pancake that don't protrude past the grip with the hoods taken off.
629,"Theres are a few lenses for the a6000 series that are absolutely pocketable, i would walk around with the 6300 and the spny 20 2.8 pancake all the time in my pocket. But to really take advantage of the system yes most lenses are big and bulky and do not make it very transportable compared to a phone. Why not just the iphone13 pro and you could get a nice stabalizer for it?"
630,Depends heavily on what you're shooting
631,"There's a pretty **huge** leap in sensors between the 7 and the 9 (and now 10 got a huge chip upgrade), but I don't sell them so not my circus. Good luck in your search, I think a high end phone known for camera spec is your next thing up in quality / size then, Pixel Pro or iPhone Pro, and then after that you're in small body + lens territory like gh5 + a 35 prime or something."
632,"Why on earth would you put an FE lens on the a6400? Or bother spending the money?

The kit zoom aps-c lens that it comes with is small and light af. The whole package is hardly a pound I bet. That’s literally one of its main selling points. 

Trying to help you dude. You want an approachable  point and shoot zoom camera that’s small and light and has solid auto everything for under 1200 bucks?

The Sony a6400 with the kit 16-50 zoom checks all those boxes and will blow a fuckin iPhone out of the water. Not to mention save you several hundred dollars.

If an aps-c mirrorless camera with a pancake lens is too large for what you’re doing, then just get the iphone. Cuz that’s about as small as decent cameras get."
633,Similar size and better quality were your 2 prerequisites but yes it is prosumer kit
634,If it (which it probably should) has a removable (which it probably should) battery I would totally invest in just a USB version of whatever charger it uses and keep a fresh battery in my pocket or bag with another charging in my bag
635,In what way is it better except for the screen and mic configuration?
636,"> There's nothing that's going fit in your pocket and exceed the capability of a 13 Pro no matter how much you spend.

I guess that be the ultimate truth unfortunately."
637,"Sure, but then there is no zoom. Rx100 vii has a 200m zoom on it on nearly twice smaller body."
638,How big of a jump is it? Noticable upgrade from 7? (Low light)
639,"No, I can truly go as high as 5k$, I mentioned that the budget is very flexible. I was just wondering if there was some corner of the market that was completely evading my radar, but this thread is slowly showing me that there ain't.

Sorry if I seemed antagonistic. Thanks for the advices!"
640,"It is removable, we just happen to like using a power bank with it as it's easier and don't have to stop recording to change batteries, just plug it in and keep chugging on - (use it as a main cam for YT channel) and that thing gotta say it's TOUGH.  


It's been soaked in transmission oil, engine oil, sees winds up to 60mph, works in plain sun, also recording cars on dynamometers with ambient temps reaching 45-50C and a few weeks ago it got rain on... still going on strong."
641,"It doesn’t have really bad over heating problems like the rx100 line has when shooting video, 4k specifically. That’s the biggest thing."
642,"100%. Besides action cams, nothing is as good as a phone right now. And those tend to suffer in low light. In bright scenes, however, they are great with some unique features (GoPro 10)."
643,if you want higher quality you lose pocketability because of this inconvenient thing caled physics
644,"Gopro has never really had good low light, but that said, the 9 does _decent_ in a lit city environment, street lights + shops, that sort of thing. Once you go off the main streets it's unusable. 10 allegedly improves on this a bit, but I don't have one so can't speak to that. 

The 7 Black is _obviously_ worse in daytime regular footage, you can find samples online if you want to see what you can pull out of them. No idea about low light specifically though, but it's not gonna be better.

EDIT: when I say find samples, I mean fairly specifically gradeable, shot in Flat profile, High bitrate setting stuff. There's a lot of idiots out there comparing the Gopro native colour profiles across generations, which is obviously completely pointless. 9 also adds HEVC as an encoding option, not sure about 8, which then makes the files more manageable, but the big sensor jump was 7 to 8, 8 to 9 is mostly a CPU change, faster readout etc."
645,The mk vi and vii don’t either. I’ll grant you the iv and v do. (I have a iv and a vii)
646,Starting to realize that. IPhone it is. 🤷‍♂️
647,"Ah I see, then I guess it’s on par video capabilities for hundreds of dollars less."

I used air coolers in both - Thermalright Silver Soul 135 and 110.

654,It goes on sale for this price every few months so if you don't want to get one now don't sweat it.
655,Finally!! Been waiting on this. Thanks OP.
656,Damn. Planned around an matx mobo but bought this case..now gotta get a mitx am4 board ha
657,"Pretty decent case to build in and a good deal considering the PSU included. I got one and slapped an Asrock ITX B550 board in there with AMD Ryzen 5600X3D, EK AIO 240 for the CPU and a Gigabyte Vision RTX 3080. Works well as a living room/home theater/gaming PC."
658,This is an \*excellent\* ITX case and just about a no-brainer at this price. The included PSU is quite good unlike the one NZXT saddled the H1 V2 with. My only real gripe is that HYTE is still shipping the goofy USB-C extension cable to drive the front I/O... though if you're using a budget board without an internal header that may actually be a pro and not a con.
659,What would be a good 1080p build for this case
660,I bought one of these last time it was on sale and HATED it.
661,what band psu is it
662,"Even at this price, the H1 V2 at $199 makes much more sense. You’re getting a AIO with much better looking case and pre-set cable management. Simplest and best case I’ve ever had. My undervolted overclocked 6800 xt trio doesn’t even reach 60c and the i5 12400 CPU is even better."
663,I wish they still made this with the copper mesh. :(
664,"good case, they sent me a replacement panel for free when it got hit by a car"
665,I wish I could buy the case by itself I don't need the psu
666,"How awful would it be for cooling to put this on its side? I'm looking to get a htpc where I'm height limited. So far I haven't found many great options under 10"" height.

Considering a sff PSU is over $100 by itself, this seems like a great deal"
667,"Built my girlfriends pc in this, no issues over a year later. Air cooler, 10400 and a 1070. She plays just retro stuff so that doesn’t push it but I’ve played the last of us on it and it got good results. Deff recommend if you want something small and not too ugly"
668,"Psu is B tier I believe, gray deal"
669,"Bought but newegg came back and said it was out of stock.

Got refunded :("
670,I picked up one from Adorama the last time it was on sale a little less than 3 months ago. It was just a few dollars cheaper than this NewEgg sale price.
671,"If you are building fresh, and don't already have parts from AM4, it would be wise to sink the little extra cost into AM5. you'll have a lot more options down the road for upgrading again."
672,"Ryzen 5 5600, RX 6600XT, cheapest B550 ITX you can find."
673,"Get the ryzen 7600, no hesitation. Pick up a used gpu on ebay - i got a 3060 ti. Then, get the cheapest itx mobo you can find for the ryzen 7600 - mine was some gigabyte for $140.

w/e gen4 2tb nvme SSD you can get your hands on that pops up here on sale.

I grabbed 32gb of ram for $80 or something. Do *not* go with only 16 - you only have 2 ram slots.

If you go with AMD cpu, do **not** get a tower cooler for your cpu. They can **not** be configured to blow out the side/back of the case. I think intel cpu coolers can freely orient in any direction but I'm not sure. This might be a valid reason to go intel cpu here - to save money on the cooler.

For AMD: AIO, or the dark rock tf 2, or maybe the noctua nhc14s are more optimal. I went through a few $30-$40 tower coolers, and they all cool it enough to reach near peak speeds during benchmark and it doesn't thermal throttle for gaming, but the dark rock did much better while also keeping the gpu cooler due to better air flow in the case. I got my dark rock tf 2 used on amazon for like $50, not a scratch on it."
674,"Don't have great suggestions to give off-hand, but you can check out some builds that others have done in the case at /r/sffpc and see what wisdom they may have to pass on"
675,Ryzen 7600 and Radeon 7600 lol
676,what is your budget?
677,5700xt and an i5 12400f
678,Was it just the size or cable management? Curious what made you hate it.
679,"Same here. Bought them on similar sale and returned it. The space for GPU doesn't align correctly, and has to be wedged against the PSU housing. It works, but you are putting unnecessary pressure on the PCI slot. You will have to remove the PSU housing's back cover for a better fit. Even then, you still have little to no room because of the PSU's cables coming out of the SFX-L, including a SFX PSU instead would mitigate the problem...

On top of that, you will need a right angle adapter for your GPU's power plugs, for most decently powerful cards anyway. At the end of the day, you can force everything in and shut the door, of course.

It's a good deal when using a small GPU though. But I don't think this case is intended for that kind of build, plenty of smaller cases out there."
680,It’s an iBuyPower branded PSU. FWIW I haven’t had any issues with mine (running a 13700K + 4070 Ti).
681,"Does the H1 v2 fit a 4090? The jute one does…
Except the included power supply couldn’t handle it I combination with a 12900k."
682,"I wish I already had a m-atx motherboard. Otherwise, I would totally snag one. Now I either save up to move my existing pc into a new case, ooooooor just build a whole new pc lol"
683,"H1 is limited to that single fan (140mm) AIO -- big design flaw imo  

where as this Hyte Revolt 3 supports 240mm and 280mm AIO"
684,You can buy it without the PSU. The problem is that it costs more than this. Go figure!
685,"I had one in a horizontal configuration, I set it up on a pack or 3/4"" height rubber feet that I got from Amazon to make sure it wasn't blocking an entire mesh panel - worked really well at cooling a 13600k with a C14S and a 6800XT (both undervolted). I swapped out the PSU to an SF750 for clearance and cable management, but the case itself rocks for a horizontal HTPC application."
686,Wish I could sell the PSU for $100... probably could only fetch $30-$40 for it.
687,I thought about it but got the 5600x for 130. I’m doing 3 value builds so trying to keep costs relatively low
688,800 usd
689,"I don't hate the case, I've built a few already. My beef with it is the cable layout. All your front IO stuff needs to get connected, but for some reason they insist on making the cables just a bit shorter than what you need. Then it has a hokey solution for the USB-C being an extension to the USB-C header in the rear IO. I'm also not fond of the fan placement. It's kinda inadequate for a high wattage system unless you're rocking an AIO."
690,"Those are check ones that reviewers use and it's not so simple. The case was poorly made, to begin with, and the power cables fit way too tightly in to my motherboard.  If you look at the features this case offers, you should plan to lose one for every one you take advantage of. Also, it looked a lot uglier than I thought it would when I saw it in person.

That said, if you like the look, and if my quality issues were just a bad copy, and I'd you plan out your build very carefully, you might be fine with it."
691,"reminder: Hyte is a subsidiary of iBuyPower. 

Also iBuyPower is the seeding company for NZXT. The owner-CEO Alex Hou is the father of NZXT's owner-CEO, Johnny Hou."
692,Says it fits 3-slot wide to 324mm length but not actual 3-slot cards
693,"That's excellent to hear, thank you. Part of what makes this case a good value is the PSU. Kind of sucks that I might need to replace it."
694,"This is about as value as it gets for this case with decent gaming performance.

[https://pcpartpicker.com/list/gxVLsh](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/gxVLsh)

You can go with a cheaper GPU if you want to save $50, but I refuse to purchase 8gb cards from this point forward."
695,"Here are 3 options

$830 AM4: the processor can be dropped to 5600, but I'd say the $30 is worth the extra 2 cores to keep background tasks from slowing games. You may need to update the bios with this. see the note at bottom of link

https://pcpartpicker.com/list/NLFY9c


$930 12th Gen i5: puts you on a ddr5 newer platform with more upgrade options that will exceed the max potential of the AM4 build. It will cost $100 more upfront though. I would pick this option.

https://pcpartpicker.com/list/TPzH28


$940 AM5 is the best choice for itx due to low power consumption, but at your budget greatly limits your motherboard option.

https://pcpartpicker.com/list/Ny8xsh"
696,"I've heard connecting the usb-c is a nightmare in this case, which matters if you want to use it for VR. It's a shame that more cases don't have handles."
697,Pretty close to what I got! I did go with a 6800 refurb I got for 320 though. And going with stock stealth wraith cooler.
698,"Oh yeah, that was another thing. I'm not sure if it's been revised, but it comes with a USB pass-through cable, not a connection to your board's internal Type-C header. That can be good or bad, depending on your board. It seems like the front panel Type-C cable should be replaceable, but it would take some work and research to source the correct kind of replacement."
699,"The front USB-C port simply plugs in via a pre-wired USB extension cable into the USB-C port on your motherboard's rear i/o.  I'm genuinely puzzled how someone would view plugging in a USB cable as being a ""nightmare"".  This allows you to use that case front USB-C port even with an older/cheaper motherboard that lacks an internal USB-C header.  Works perfectly fine with my VR headset."
700,hell of a trade off if that cooler fits. that'll be a solid 1440p machine.
701,"If you have about $200 to spare, the quadro RTX A2000 is an amazing card, providing RTX 3050 performance, only drawing about 70W. RX6400 is also an OK  option, but  you dont have pcie 4.0 so it may not be the best. Also get a boot SSD, like a 240GB one for about $15-20"
702,"I was in your position man, went with the 1030, paid like 97$ for it. Trust me man, just sell that shit and buy a normal pc, you can get a way better gpu for good money in today's market"
703,"Dell's galaxy-brained decision to put the PCIe 3.0 x16 slot right next to the PSU means you can only use single-slot low profile cards. The RX 6400 is the most powerful of these, but you can't get full performance out of it without a PCIe 4.0-capable system. Personally I'd try to find an Nvidia T600. It's a cut down GTX 1650 with a 40W TDP that should trade blows with the GTX 1630."
704,"I have an old Dell (i5-4590) I set up for my son with an RX 560 I got for $50 used on ebay. It plays Fortnite (\~55fps), Minecraft, and Star Wars Battlefront 2 (\~100fps) fine at 900p.

Honestly, I wouldn't sink a lot of money into SFF box. So that 560 and and SSD would be all I'd commit to it. I'd also try to move the cables around to make sure the airflow is as unrestricted as possible. Dell cases in general are pretty closed-up, and SFF is only going to make that worse."
705,"hi
you will be limited by the PSU as 200watts is quite low
go for a 1050ti as it drain 75 watts maximum through the pic express port.

a 1650 would be suitable according to this thread
https://www.reddit.com/r/sffpc/comments/gjb0jc/gtx_1650_lp_in_a_250w_psu/

a 1660 require more power roughly 120/130 watts so it will not be suitable for you.

as many, I will advice you to put a SSD into your pc and you would be fine"
706,"Gt 1030 or wx pro 3100 for single slot height lower power. 

1050 ti or 1650 for a double height card if you aren't using your second pcie slot. 

Does that rig have pcie 4.0? If so you could check rx 6400

I have a gt 1030 in a sff w/ i5-3470, runs overwatch great at 1080p, most graphically intensive games I've played are control and nioh, both run great on lowest settings possible. Tried running elden ring once on it, hard no. But it does dark souls 1,2,3"
707,"RX 550, GT 1030 or at the very least a GTX 745. A 730 isn't really worth the money compared to using just the Intel UHD 630.

The best card for that PC would be the RX 6400. Lesser cards like GTX 1050 Ti or RX 460/560 can be found without power connectors, but for safety I would keep the GPU TDP to around 50W maximum considering your power supply.

Also, get an SSD for the main drive."
708,Check out external graphics cards. You may be able to get a decent one with today's prices

710,I'd consider upgrading the psu if you can office pc power supplies tend to have jssues later on.
711,"I have a 750ti that played (original) Dead Space max detail, 1080p 60fps; GTAV on a mix of normal to high settings (more than the 2GB VRAM would've let me up textures). Haven't played those others, though. But there's a bit of a reference point for you.

A 730 is pointless, wouldn't really go with a 1030. If you're buying retail, options aren't great, both in terms of availability and value. Least-worst would be a low-profile 1650, I guess. Even if buying secondhand, the SFF really limits options. So yeah, I'd probably just get that, new or used, would cover all those games well enough (depending on your standards).

And yeah, being PCI-e 3.0, I'd avoid the RX 6400 or RX 6500, unless in the unlikely event you stumbled on some amazing deal and understood you would be sacrificing performance.

An SSD would be a nice QoL upgrade too, and SSD prices are dropping significantly so it's a good time (albeit I'm seeing this more in the nvme space...does the 3080 have an m.2 slot?). It'll make your life nicer and load things faster, but don't expect it to improve FPS.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Someone else noted this case can only take single-slot cards, so that may invalidate my (and others) recommendations!"
712,"Best options: RTX A2000.
Next best: GTX 1650 or RX 560

713,"1650 Super, great on a budget and great performance too"
714,$200 where? Secondhand? Why bother with a Quadro at this point?
715,"According to ETA Prime on YT a bunch of used 6GB models have been showing up on eBay and Amazon lately, though it's closer to $250 IIRC. The A2000 is the fastest low profile GPU on the planet, not that it matters because it's dual-slot and won't fit in OP's case."
716,">a bunch of used 6GB models have been showing up on eBay and Amazon lately

Former mining cards? And looking at ebay they're nearly all over $250.

I guess I didn't really consider it being low profile, and the efficiency is very appealing, especially in some parts of the world right now (but also just in principle).

But if someone is willing to go secondhand to get the A2000, I wonder if it wouldn't make more sense just to flip the SFF in favor of a full height case and get a similarly performing or better GPU for less. You're still paying a premium for it being a Quadro."
717,"> You're still paying a premium for it being a Quadro.

Does it really matter if you still get the best performance LP GPU?"

719,Does anywhere else stock Fractal cases at MSRP? I really want a Torrent but don't want to buy from Newegg. B&H sort of does but they drop ship it and told me they don't know when it would get to me.

727,The real question is can I fit an EVGA 3070 in here?
728,"A lot of the larger 3080s-3090tis and 4070tis-4090s wouldn't fit in this and if they did, the thermals would be pretty bad. I had a node 202 and these vertical cases can't get rid of more than 500watts of heat well."
729,"I must be dyslexic, I didn’t know this was r/BuildAPCMSRP"
730,There's a picture of someone with a stock 3090ti in it... How can anything survive in there?
731,Too bad it's Newegg...
732,"Do you think this case will still be in production for a while?

I plan on building a sff PC for my living room over the summer, and I really want this case. I know it's been sold out for a while so I don't want it to disappear on me when I'm ready to buy/build. I suppose I could buy it now and sit on it, but I'd really rather not if it won't get discontinued anytime soon."
733,"I think my next build may be SFF. I literally just bought a mini PC that was on sale with some good specs, but looking at this I had an extra battery and GPU laying around that makes me wonder if I should have went this route.. 

Would have cost me about $50 bucks more at least to get this instead (well I have an extra 500GB SSD laying around too that's already included in the mini PC as well as extra RAM) based on what I already have extra of. May accidentally end up with 3 PC's. I normally make old ones severs though to be fair. I really like the idea behind a nicely built SFF that actually supports full size GPU's. I can utilize even old GPU's on my servers and I might make em public facing for extra oomph. Can add it as a gaming server and media server as well remotely."
734,what's the significance of this case specifically? like why is it sought after over other cases?
735,I haven’t kept up to date but how does this compare to a fractal node 202?  Thermals better with the ridge or node 202?
736,Still rocking the Node 202 in 2023 :)
737,How does the Ridge compare to the Node 202? Specifically interested in size and thermals. It seems from the product description that the ridge is a tad wider.
738,"I broke down and bought the case from B&H photo. Purchased on 1/8, got shipping notification on 1/11, and got the case delivered on 1/17. So not ideal to have to rely on a drop shipment, but not a bad experience overall.

739,Microcenter ships cases as well. I believe they tend to be around MSRP but that's hit or miss depending on the sale that week.

750,"[Per fractal](https://www.fractal-design.com/ridge-riser-card-pcie-4-0/) seems like this is technically the 4.0 cable but some may experience instability with it, so they recommend setting it to 3.0 if you have issues, and they updated the listing to only state 3.0 for now."

752,Yes.
753,"SFF cases are categorized by volume.

The Node 202 (one of the smallest SFF cases on the market) is going to struggle with thermals and fitting larger GPUs

This case is much larger and can support GPUs up to 335mm in length and 82mm in width. That would support a 4080 founder's edition.

I have a Meshlicious (also a vertical case). It can also fit a 4080 founders and I've got a 4070 TI installed running at 65C stock (75C after turning the fan speed down to like 40%-50%)"
754,"This is not true. This case, especially the GPU gets same temperatures as the best ATX cases available due to the side intake fans."
755,"I have a 3080ti fe in mine, thermals are fine.  It's essentially an open case with the mesh design of the side panels.   I used to have a node 202 and that wasn't great for thermals for sure, but the ridge is much better."

759,"It just released 2 months ago. It was OOS because of riser issues.

The case seems very popular for SFF from what I've seen.

I'd definitely say wait until summer, they still haven't fully ""resolved"" the riser issues. The price will likely come down once it's stocked at more retailers to $129.99 + FS"
760,This'll probably be around for a while so I wouldn't be worried.

769,"No, it's that I didn't forget about the last several times."
770,The Compact and Nano seem to have more stock. I'm wanting the full-size.
771,"Thanks. Yeah I'm quite interested in making the smallest possible build with a 3080, I saw the pics and its the closest I've seen to my thoughts so far"
772,The lesson is never buy any Fractal products at initial release with a PCB component. It is guaranteed to not work as shown in their previous fan hub PCB recall
773,"This case is tricky. If you use a decent size cpu cooler liken the noctua l12, put the GPU side down and use feet (not the one that comes with the case, that one will choke the PSU and worsen the CPU temps) it runs super cool, especially the GPU. The cpu also gets decent temperatures but never hot. This is the best setup for me, I’m getting even better temps than vertical and approximately same as meshlicious, which is regarded as one of the best cooled ITX cases."
774,"Ya, and here's a PS5 next to a mid tower:

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EmpjLmiXIAA0ymJ.jpg"
775,"I think a lot of people consider anything below 20L to pass as ""SFF"", and this case is 12.9L. Looks like the PS5 takes up about 10.5L, which is big for a console, but still way smaller than any mid-towers. The NZXT H510, one of the most popular mid-towers, is over 41L."
776,Thanks
777,"Volume-wise, the Ridge isn't that much bigger."
778,"But you can't use the side intake fans if you have a thicker, high-end GPU. Then you are dependent on thinner, smaller diameter fans on the GPU as intake. The reviews for the case use mostly lower power cards like 3060ti or 3050 so the temps look good because of the help of the intake fans. But when you have a factory overclocked x80,x90 3 or 4 series card in there (if it even fits). The temps would probably be unmanageable because of the higher power and lack of intake fans when you using a bigger card."
779,Okay
780,"Awesome. Good to know. I wasn't sure how old the model/design was, so I didn't know if the recent out of stock was because of them winding it down. Thanks for the reply."
781,Yup
782,You're pretty limited on CPU cooler height so if you are good with that knowledge then it's a really nice case with good GPU support
783,"Lucky for you, there's plenty of others who wanted to do the same thing.  r/sffpc will have a spreadsheet you can reference and threads you can peruse."
784,Look at some sandwich style cases. Like Velka has some great very small cases. r/sffpc is a great resource.
785,You can technically go a few liters smaller in a sandwich style case like the Q58 or the A4 H2O as well.
786,"It entirely depends on how much time/effort/money you want to put into it and how much you can compromise on sound/performance/temperatures. You can definitely go quite a bit smaller, with both sandwich and console style cases. For example, the CustomMOD SLM3 is another console at 7.5L compared to the 12.9L of the FD Ridge, and it can also fit a 3080 (though I don't know enough about that case to give it a recommendation). Something like the FormD T1 (sandwich) would be also a pretty comfortable fit at about 10L. But both of those are much more expensive."
787,Jesus my eyes deceive me.
788,It's a recent release so the out of stock was just due to not meeting initial demand.
789,Well then that's a good sign.
790,I saw the speaker and immediately thought THAT was the pc I was so amazed and now I feel stupid
791,Super clean. 
792,What speaker is that? Or the name of the speaker. Btw you have a super clean setup!

798,"I love how the room is so clinically clean and white, even the ground. Makes it look like a laboratory. That setup adds a pretty nice contrast. "
799,"Black and Purple, my favorite color scheme by far
Nice Setup!
Got any close up photos of your build? I see hints of purple on the sides of it

And your mouse mat looks amazing. Where you get it at?"
800,The white with purple makes me tingle 
801,You've been posting the same setup for 6 months now? 
802,Is that a steelcase leap v2 👀 a man of culture I see
803,Does anyone know where I can learn more about setting up PCs like this
804,mic arm? 
805,"I have my wireless phone charging dock setup the same way. I can see messages from people while playing
 for example: 

It's 2am, playing a game while things are getting lit. I receive a text from my wife who is supposed to be sleeping
""Babe, you're yelling"" or ""you're yelling again"""
806,how do you get your wallpaper span properly across different monitor resolution/orientation?
807,I bet r/sffpc would appreciate this
808,That keyboard... Whyyyy
809,How did you mount your microphone like that? That looks amazing!
810,Small ass keyboard 😂
811,wew sexy! looks like an x-wing!
812,"Do you mean, minimalistic?"
813,"Haha all good, the pc is on the far side and is just as small as the speaker."
814,Audioengine B2 and thanks!
815,"Well I do, just not upstairs lol."
816,"Thats the only thing on here I don’t recommend. They keyas are all normal size, its just a 40% keyboard meaning there is no num pad, no f row and no number row. Its not really that great, I just wanted to test it out since I have a couple other keyboards as well."
817,"Thanks, its taken me a bit to get here"
818,"I use two ergotech freedom arms and a vivi wall mount. The freedom arms are very adjustable, very sturdy and pretty pricey. In terms of sag, very little since the middle monitor is wall mounted it also really helps that this desk has a middle leg. These arms arent super easy to adjust, but I have NEVER had anything hold this well over long periods. Almost every other arm I have owned typically moves out of place with heavy monitors after only a day or two. These won’t ever move out of place unless I physically move them. "
819,"Thanks, its a pretty common desk. Its the 78” ikea linnmon with two alex drawer units on either end. Its a decent desk but they certainly aren’t great build quality."
820,Yeah I can post some more later from an imgur link. The mouse mat was from a guy that sold them on the mechanical keyboard forums but you can get them in aliexpress if you search cherry prism mat.
821,"Yeah my setup only really changes once a year. While Im at college it basically just looks like this without the nice walls / shelves, so people wouldn’t like it nearly as much."
822,Well of course. The most comfortable chair I have ever sat in might I add.
823,Look at r/battlestations for inspiration and once you feel comfortable trying it yourself you can go for it. I spend hours cable managing this every time I come home from school since I bring most of it with me. 
824,Rode PSA1
825,"Just an illusion, they aren’t properly spanned. Display fusion could work if you did a lot of adjusting, but it would be hard."
826,This is so true!
827,Well because I have many keyboards and its fun to try new ones
828,There is a mount that comes with the mic that allows you to drill a hole in the desk and place it wherever you want. 
829,I get that and tie fighter a lot lol
830,As opposed to small form factor? No they are totally different.
831,How does a single stereo speaker work in gaming? Can you hear if a sound is coming from left or right side? Wouldn't it be better to have two separate mono speakers on both ends of your desk?

834,Thanks 
835,"Ahh that's quite cool, def looks nicer than the clamp, I'd just be worried regretting my mounting decision in the future as it's a tad permanent. Keyboard holes are fine to me since you will always have a keyboard there but not always a mic arm ;) "
836,This person know what they are about
837,"I suppose having two would be better, but honestly if Im doing any sort of gaming that requires intense listening I just use headphones regardless lol."
838,Thanks!

840,"Also available in white, albeit for $4 more with code HYTENV88A

Pretty sure this is the all-time low for this case, at least for the black variant. Looks like a great deal. It's hard to even find a decent fully modular sfx power supply at this wattage for this price.

Things to keep in mind:

\- The PSU is rated speculative C-tier on the Cultist tier list. Reviews say that the cables are quite stiff and are just a tad too short for the CPU and GPU, meaning cable management is a bit tricky. But for this price, that's fine imo.  
\- The USB-C connector on the front is a passthrough cable and it connects to the port on the rear I/O of the motherboard. Kind of annoying, but great for budget motherboards that don't have a front type-c connector."
841,"🤔 i want it but don’t need it, great price though!"
842,I've done a few builds in this its usually great. I did have to buy some 8 pin GPU extensions for a 3080 as the stock cables wouldn't reach
843,"bought one last time it was on sale, and this is by far the best itx case i've ever worked with -- super easy to build with, and it's so quiet even with a 240mm radiator installed"
844,"If anyone wants just the case, I just want the psu

edit: no longer looking"
845,"If you're building in this case, are you revolting? 🤔"
846,Best deal for building a system that takes up this little desk space
847,Dunno if it’s normal but mine only came with one pcie cable for the gpu and I’m having a heck of a time finding the proper cable to add a second one. Hyte support has not responded to support tickets created on discord or their support site for about 2 weeks. Still trying to find the psu OEM so I can just Amazon the right pcie cable.
848,"I know I'm stupid, but is there ANY ITX mobo with AMD socket? I bought an ITX case months ago for next to nothing and it's just sitting there cause I'm the idiot who didn't research"
849,"I've had this case for a year now and it's been fantastic. I'm using an AsRock B650E PG-ITX mobo with originally a Ryzen 7700X, now 7800X3D. It's watercooled with a 240mm rad and has housed a 6800XT, a 7900XT, and now an AsRock 7900XTX (Phantom Gaming). It's a heavy case but I carry it to different houses a ton. It can fit surprisingly large GPUs without needed a riser and keeps it stable and snug.  
&nbsp;  
I didn't want to waste a rear I/O USB-C port with the front panel passthrough so I used this adapter (https://www.amazon.com/LINKUP-Motherboard-Extension-Key-Connector/dp/B07THC8ZVF?th=1). One of the strengths and weaknesses of this this case is the rear I/O being at the bottom of the case. It's great for a clean, cable managed look but annoying to lift to unplug and replug. I don't mind that trade off. I've never had no thermal or power throttling issues with the included PSU and the 7900XTX even while running demanding titles like Cyberpunk, RDR2, etc. I probably will upgrade it to a higher wattage, more silent PSU in the future. Definitely get PSU extension cables as the included cables are incredibly short and tough to cable manage."
850,Can you replace the pass through cable with a header cable?
851,the 7th product image shows an IbuyPower branded PSU lol
852,I built a system in this case. With all the panels off its easy to build in.
853,"Hmm, I'll take the Power Supply, and you take the case."
854,"i just want the case, where are you located? maybe we can work something out :)"
855,I can vouch for the AsRock B650E PG-ITX if you're looking at going with the latest AM5 socket. I've used it in this case for a year and it's been great! Just make sure you're on the latest bios version. It unfortunately doesn't have BIOS flashback so you need to manually download the update to a usb drive and flash it in the bios settings. Make sure the flash drive is formatted in FAT and that you plug it into your rear I/O of the mobo rather than the front I/O.
856,Yes there are ITX mobo with AMD socket b550i b650i.
857,"Yes, of course. Not many, but there are a few for each Ryzen gen. I have an Asus and an MSI B450i board. You could have easily looked it up in the time it took you to write this post lol."
858,I was planning to pair this with a ryzen 7700 and 7900 xtx myself and I’m happy to hear the PSU is good enough for it. How are the thermals on the cpu and gpu?
859,What slot gpu will fit? Is it only 2 slot gpus or will 3 slots work as well?
860,"I don’t think so. However, you could probably use an adapter cable like [this](https://a.co/d/0ZBd4a9)."
861,Yep I have this case and that's what I did. Here's the adapter I used: https://www.amazon.com/LINKUP-Motherboard-Extension-Key-Connector/dp/B07THC8ZVF?th=1
862,You can get at least get adapters that attach to the motherboard header of your choosing
863,Is that a surprise? HYTE is sister brand of iBUYPOWER.
864,"OEM is High Power (Sifra), who also make SFX PSUs for NZXT and Silverstone IIRC."
865,Agreed my only problem area was the guard at the PSU cables.  I took it out with no problems after that.
866,pming you
867,Thank you for the vouch!
868,The thermals are great for the GPU and solid for the CPU. The Ryzen 7000 series run hotter by design compared to the 5000 series. They can safely run in the mid 90s. I would avg about 80C with peaks of 90C with 240mm rad watercooling over several hours of gameplay and CPU+GPU load. With minimal workloads it averages mid 60s. No thermal throttling whatsoever. The thing it does affect is acoustics since the fans will kick in. You can spend some time setting your fan curves and calibrating it to your liking
869,3 slots fit. Just consider the power cable clearance. I grabbed one of these 180 degree adapters: https://a.co/d/6b6zYNU
870,"Did you need to unscrew the existing cable and screw the one from Amazon in?

&#x200B;

I have one of these:

871,It is to me. And that PSU doesn't exactly inspire confidence here as IBP tends to cheap out on quality with many of their branded components
872,I unscrewed the PCI ~~slot~~ bracket from the Amazon cable and just directly connected it to the case’s passthrough cable. That way it won’t take up a PCI slot if I choose to add an expansion card of some sort
873,I didn't have any issue with the PSU performance but the cables were dogshit
874,"By slot, you mean bracket, I assume?"
875,"for the PSU, it's not the performance, but the fire safety that matters  


also, there are things like ripple and other indicators of reliability that may impact the lifespan of the rest of the components in your system. **The PSU is the most important part of your computer.**

EDIT: the PSU is not rated but is shown on https://cultists.network/140/psu-tier-list/"
876,Sorry yeah that’s what I mean
877,No He Ment Deez......
878,"I wholeheartedly agree with you and approach these things with a critical mindset. The earlier days (90's-00's) of included power supplies with cases made me shy away away from them in general due to the risks, however with a manufacturer that has some skin in the game at this point, it doesn't give me too much cause for concern. With the cost of similar specced power supplies being what they are, it does bring up the concern of quality.   


If this were dodgey enough for you to bust out testing methods to check it right out of the box I'd recommend a more expensive unit to get the peace of mind that comes with it, skip the ordeal, or sell it on r/hardwareswap to offset the cost because someone else will readily buy it. I appreciate the comment either way as the PSU *is* the most important part of the computer."
879,Mackies look way better without that shitty razer green look. Well done! 
880,"Air 240 isn't a small form factor but hey, more room for lights I guess."

888,"How's the Predator? Trying to decide whether or not to get this or the ROG Swift based on looks.

Also what's your audio interface setup?"
889,The white case. Is that your old case? Is that the NZXT S340?
890,Have you got the mackies hooked up to your audio interface? or to the PC? Also can you see the 'marker marks' after you coloured the green in?
891,Just noticed this... OP how did you change the green?
892,Thanks! The green was irritating the shit out of me. Now only if I can get rid of the red on that monitor base. 
893,Micro ATX isnt a small form factor? It sure looks small to me. 
894,"http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/50106773/

This is the desk. I stained it with a walnut stain and coated it with 3 polyurethane coats."
895,"I also have the CR4's and I've been really pleased with them. Nice sound, a bit more on the bassy side (which I prefer)."
896,"They are the CR3 and I personally like them. I know an audiophile will say they sound like crap, but to me they fill my needs and sound great. I would recommend for sure."
897,It has been moved to under the desk to help with sweaty giblets.
898,I got it from this wallpaper dump http://imgur.com/a/SU6bL
899,I have four 120mm fans on the radiator in push pull. Obviously not that necessary but I had extra fans and they fit so why not. I have two 120mm fans up top for exhaust and two small 80mm suckers exploding out the back. My temps are surprisingly great. Full load gaming is about max 68-70c on Battlefield 1 with 4.8 OC on the CPU and around the same for the gpu at about 2050mhz. Prime95 gets the CPU to about 75c max at 100% sustained load. 
900,I wasn't gonna trust that little ass clamp. I removed the clamp and used the holes that were already there to screw it down. Works like a charm
901,Also the case is great and I would for sure recommend. 
902,"The predator is incredible. I was honestly so impressed with it. My only gripe is the base being red, but that's really a non issue. My audio set up is an m-audio fast track pro. One output goes to speakers, one goes to wireless Logitech gaming headset and the headphone jack in the front is for my ATH-M50x's."
903,That is correct
904,"I am aware you can see the marker marks, but under normal lighting conditions, I never see them. Its 100% better than that nasty green. They are plugged into my audio interface output along with my wireless headset."
905,"Masking tape, a razor, and a black paint marker."
906,It's certainly smaller than your standard ATX case but generally speaking small form factor is for MITX systems and smaller. 
907,have you tried ln2?
908,[deleted]
909,What your opinion it?? I'm looking to upgrade my part and also getting a new case. The NZXT S340 is on my list
910,"True, I have the CR5BT and the green is nassssty. Contemplating taking them apart to spray paint, but considering what you did instead. 

What model is your audio panel?"
911,"Stupid question, but what is the razor for? Got the mackies as well, and always wanted to paint this stupid green ring."
912,Well I can barely fit that BBC of a gpu into my PC with water cooling and it's half the height of my last mid tower. It's very cramped so I can consider it a *smaller* form factor. 
913,Not sure what that is :/
914,"Surprisingly easy aside from the FTW. The card is so tall regular cables wouldn't work. I needed to get low profile 8 pin cables to be able to comfortably close the side panel. I'm most likely going to try and get rid of the ftw and get a 1080 TI SC to fit in that spot a little better. Aside from that, it was easy. "
915,"The ONLY reason I didn't transfer my parts over is because the case was white and I wanted to make everything uniform. The case itself is really great, cable management is a breeze and its solid build quality. If I had a gripe, it'd be the top exhaust only having one fan slot. There could have been more but I'm sure it was done in the name of aesthetic. Aside from that, killer case. "
916,An older M-Audio Fast Track Pro
917,I used a flexible single shaving razor blade to slide in between the small gaps in the plastic so I could mask the green off easier. It was indeed much easier when properly masked. 
918,"Indeed, but I think people get confused as SFF (small form factor) is the category for console-like cases"
919,Okay thanks. I believe the fan wouldn't be that much of an issue. for me. IDK if i want to go with liquid cooling or regular heatpipes cooler
920,"Ah okay, so you can't take them out either? Tried it several times but I'm afraid that these rings are just going to break."
921,"I've tried too, no luck. Patience and a marker gets good results. "
922,"Alright, thanks! One last question, what kind of marker did you use? A simple Edding?
"
923,A cheap non branded marker but it worked great. 
924,"Minirig, nothing else comes close"
925,"I'd recommend the JBL Charge 4. It costs about 80 Euros here and has a decent sound! I used to plug it into my DDJ-400 when I first started mixing. You only need to buy an RCA to Aux cable to connect it to your decks. It's not battery powered though, but has a long life."
926,"Check out Oluv's Gadgets on youtube if you want to see some real-world testing. Dude's channel is the best speaker review I've ever seen and he's got everything from the size that'll fit in the palm of your hand up to the Soundboks. He's really hot on the JBL Partybox

927,"For backpack-sized, Bose S1 Pro no doubt. It even has its own backpack. I usually use it in the booth, but 2 can do the work for small events."
928,"My JBL Charge works perfectly for this.  It’s an early mode, but I run RCA to 3.5 and it does the trick perfectly"
929,"Not that it would fit into a backpack, but the Soundboks gen 3 is the best portable speaker you can get basically for battery life + connectivity + sound, and has an attachment that converts it into a backpack too"
930,I use a Bose Soundlink. It constantly surprises me how much power the little thing has.
931,"What size backpack?

Are we talking ""a week on the Adirondack Trail"" backpack or ""a let's find a shady spot for a picnic"" backpack?

Do you actually plan to hike with this?

If not, why limit answer to whatever can fit into a hypothetical backpack?

If so, why?"
932,"Wondering if anyone here is using soundcore motion+ for this purpose? I'm doing a two month trip and would like to bring something portable to practice with... According to most sources the sound is great, still my only worry is latency."

934,100hrs battery life from such a small form factor? seems to good to be true bro - i'm not sure it can compete volume and low freq wise with bigger speakers?

936,"Thanks for the recommendation! Will look into the JBL range, although i'm worried about the latency."
937,">the best portable speaker you can get basically for battery life + connectivity + sound

I am kind of tired of hearing this in this forum.  Soundboks really got you guys with their marketing.

Look I get it, it's loud and small... it's also really fucking expensive.  Compare a Soundboks @ $1000 with offerings from JBL or ElectroVoice around $1000 and then we are having a real comparison.

Every comparison I've seen with Soundboks puts them up against speakers that cost half as much!  Of fucking course the Soundboks should win, they cost 2x as much!

Soundboks is like Beats, they paid a fuck ton to be featured in Forbes so the /r/wallstreetbets crowd can be wowed over by stuff they don't understand.

It is not a professional speaker.  It is for pharmabros that have too much money and not enough sense.  It's made by a kickstarter company.  They won't be around in a few years to support your expensive toy like JBL.

I'd wager that the company themselves is really hoping they get bought out because if they don't they will be bankrupt soon with how much money they are pouring into marketing to inexperienced DJs and producers."
938,"Didnt knew about the Minirig speakers, but went on a search and stepped on this vid.

I use mine for listening to tunes and podcasts as well as making music when not at the desk using my proper monitors

Connection can be Bluetooth or via the 3.5 cable included. The clarity on the Minirig even at its loudest is unmatchable imo when it comes to these kind of speakers"
940,I've got a Charge 4 for casual play with a DDJ-400 and latency is fine with the RCA to 3.5mm. Not an issue (for me). Great little speaker.
941,"Frankly if you're playing out of your backpack, I would recommend you get used to headphone mixing. Latency isn't a problem when you're not relying on your monitor, and if you're just doing a single speaker it's better to point it outward than to use it as a monitor."
942,All JBL Bluetooth speakers have just enough latency even wired that it will make beatmatching by ear a pain so you either need to mix in headphones or use the sync button.
943,RCA to aux cable so not wireless.
944,Another vote for the JBL Charge I have a Charge 3 and love it.
945,"I just looked over the electrovoice webpage, they do have portable speakers, but they don't seem to have battery powered speakers, is that correct?

Btw, they where selling speakers before kickstarter. Friend of mine from Copenhagen got one of the earlier models AFAIK.

Edit: JBL EON ONE Compact looks cool

Edit2: But Eon one is also the only portable battery speaker in the range?"
946,Thanks for the recommendation - looks like it has next to zero latency. The 2.1 Setup seems unreal. Cheers.
947,"Most modern 'portable' speakers utilise a DSP that introduces latency. This DSP addresses all signal input, not just from bluetooth.

948,"That is correct the JBL EON One is probably the closest competitor and costs only 55% of what the soundboks costs.

To do a ""fair comparison"" I'd kind of think you need to spend similar money so for the price of 1x Soundboks I could nearly get 2x JBL EON battery powered.

OR I could get 1x EV ZLX 12BT + **a [generator](https://smile.amazon.com/Jackery-Portable-Explorer-Generator-Optional/dp/)** for the price of paying for 1x Soundboks!

Is 1x Soundboks really a better buy than a EV 12"" + Generator?  I honestly don't think so.  Unless you really need the extreme portability of Soundboks I don't see the point.  It's like a device that is looking for an actual market.  I guess if you do extremely high end physical training out at the park or beach or something and have the extreme budget since you are overcharging everyone for your service.

It just doesn't make sense for anyone that is a pro IMHO.  It's priced more expensive than most pro gear.

I am fully lost on why people like this thing!?!?  I mean if it cost $500 I could see the appeal but I don't see any appeal at $1000.

950,Digital dj tips recently did some testing on this kind of small speakers and the MINIRIGs came out on top
951,"You won’t regret it

100 hours battery life is a bit of a reach imo unless mine is a bit dodgy. You will be blown away by the sound quality and volume it is capable of and I’m talking specifically about a single Minirig 3. Can only imagine how good it sounds with 2 of those and the sub!"
952,"I haven't noticed a delay on my JBL Charge 3.  It's good to see testing but keep in mind that according to that link the OP that did the testing attempted to do it **in store** while testing those speakers so probably not the most accurate test setup.


>I was in a store so I turned up the output volume on the speakers which clipped the Internal mic. The waveforms are only usable to view in regards to their starting points, and I as I had a feeling when playing through them - they had a lot of latency....

So anyway cool test and it' better than nothing so a good starting point but I wouldn't say those tests are 100% accurate but more like a best effort with what the guy had available at the time.

Maybe I'll try to test the latency on mine and post result."

964,"So far it feels like my 11 pro max when I first got it. It’s good but nothing amazing but it is still indexing I believe, so it should get even better in a week. How about you?"
965,"My phone was at 90% when I opened it, I had to download few apps and exchange what was on my phone to this phone, plus a whole hour on Lte listening to music and I managed to have 3h40min sot. So I feel almost 4h sot + all the downloading I feel like it’s holding up good. Also it is still indexing as I mentionnes above"
966,"Definitely the best phone to get as your first iPhone! Welcome to the fam.

As for the battery, definitely the Pro Max's battery is miles ahead in terms of keeping more mileage for battery consumption habits such as watching YouTube, playing games and etc. 

The 13 Mini works best with the MagSafe Battery Pack because from the way I've been using the phone, it's the best option to keep on you if you wanna have the battery last a full day; but i resonate with the sentiment that they're overpriced, in which they are... but they're like the most elegantly-designed piece of hardware when compared to 3rd party manufacturers.

But then again, I don't blame it because of its form factor. TLDR, worth a downsize of a screen even if it meant a smaller battery capacity because I can now actually use the phone one-handed."
967,"Damn.. You must take good care of your phones to have just lost 10% on your 11 PM. 

And the 13mini seems to be pretty good then. I suppose I didnt take into account the indexing. As you mentioned, hope to get a better sot a few days later."
968,"Thank you 😎. And I agree. I believe on a day if we gotta travel or use it for a longer period, a battery pack is a must.

Will try to play around and see how long a single charge takes..

Kinda feel we got it at the right time.. Heard it could get discontinued by the time 14 is released."
969,"I think there will always be a market for the 4"" screen size. One handed use is the key reason. The 6+ is just not a one handed device. I currently have the 5s and will probably upgrade to the 6S+ next year. But I can def see why they would bring the 4"" form factor back. "
970,"I was hoping for this. I actually bought my first iPhone ever last month and I specifically chose a 5S over a 6 or 6+ because of the size. I moved in the other direction, after having 4.7-5"" phones I decided I wanted to downsize and simplify and I'm glad I did. I would like the option to buy a 4"" phone next time too possibly. I might go to 4.2"" but that is the absolute limit. I hope Apple reconsiders the ""cheap"" part though. The majority of iPhone users seem to have really liked the form factor for YEARS. Apple shouldn't just assume they ALL want a 6"" phone now and penalize anyone who doesn't with lower specs and cheap components. If anything a cheap 6"" device would be just the thing to attract the users of another cheap and tacky phone platform which shall remain nameless.  

Make a 4"" entry level 6c or whatever, but give us a premium or at least upper mid-range 4-4.2"" model too. "
971,"After using my 6 plus for a few months now then using a friend's 5S, the 4"" screen just seems hilariously small now. It's like ""how did I ever manage to use this before"" small to me now. "
972,"I really hope they make 4"" iPhones in the future. Even with my large hands, the iPhone 6 feels awkward to hold and use. The 4"" form factor was ergonomically perfect imo. 

"
973,"iPhone 6S Mini.

That's a lot of syllables."
974,"If it were available with the same internals as the 6 and 6+, I would be all over this like aluminium on a Jonny Ive design. "
975,"Yes, please! With 100% feature parity."
976,6 Dash
977,"The size of the 5s is perfect for me to use one handed. I'm not saying Apple shouldn't continue the 4.7 and 5.5 inch screens. But I would love to see a new iPhone with the 4 inch screen.

Given how the 6 and 6 Plus are fairly close to the same internals (except for the optical image stabilization in the 6 Plus), I wouldn't be surprised for another 4 inch model to include the latest specs. At the very least, it'll match the current iPhone 6. "
978,"I would not want a 4"" phone, but I would love to see the option for people who do."
979,"Just got an iPhone 6 after using an iPhone 4S for 3 years. I don't like to get a new phone until I absolutely have to, but I'll switch to a 4-inch iPhone 6 next year if I can."
980,"Oh god please, I need this"
981,"Thank fuck for that, the more I use a 6 the more retarded every decision they made seems.

Oh and flat sides again too please so you can actually rest the thing horizontally and make use of the timer photo function.

Fucking ""Reachability"" haha, Jobs would be spinning in his grave."
982,Kill me with that name.
983,"My wife bought me a 6 last month, just don't like the larger size, obviously it was a nice gift but I miss my 5s, if I'd known there was going to be another that size I'd have asked her to wait."
984,"Given the choice, i'd keep purchasing the 4"" form factor.  I have an iPad for stuff that requires a bigger screen.  My phone is used primarily for texting and listening to podcasts.  It sits in my pocket or on a table most of the day.  "
985,"I'd hope so, even the normal 6 is sorta big for me. Heck, after using my 5s for a year I'd love something smaller than that.  Maybe because I have small hands I'd typically have my iPad with me but I just don't really want to carry a phone that large.  The general trend towards bigger phones lately has made me pretty uncomfortable.  "
986,"Yes! But not a stripped down version. I want top of the line with the phone-sized form factor.
"
987,"5s with the 6 plus camera, better display, improve battery life, and full features of the 6. I hate how thin my 6 plus is. The 5s was perfect. "
988,So Apple is going to do the exact same thing that the Android faithful bitch about Android vendors doing.  Make a smaller screen phones and use gimped components.  Why not match the specs on the smaller screen with your flagship phone?  Some people want nice specs without having to have a huge screen.  Why is that so hard for hardware vendors to grasp?
989,[deleted]
990,"The ONLY way they should do this is if all sizes have the same features/performance/specs. If not, it's a much too complicated lineup that Steve Jobs would never have allowed. (Not joking)."
991,I'm not surprised!
992,It's just a really slick phone. Do you know what I mean?
993,"I like the 6 size.  With each size up I realize it makes surfing the web easier, which is safe to say the #1 thing I use my phone to do.

That being said if they came out with a iPhone 6 mini, I bet there would be a market for it, and shut a lot of people up.

If I were just using my phone mainly as a phone, personal assistant (siri is great), or podcast/music player, a 4 inch device would fit my needs.

However, surfing the web a lot or looking up funny cat videos in any significant way, lends me to want a larger screen.

I will say having gone from the 5 to the 6, that even on the 6 i find myself stretching a tad to access things o the screen."
994,Right in time for my phone renewal :P
995,[deleted]
996,"I sure hope so. I never thought Apple would totally abandon the 4"" screen because of the ergonomics of it- it's too essential to their design philosophy to drop it. That said I have a 6 Plus and it's the right device for me at the moment. If I could afford a new iPad though? I would want a 4"" screen and not the larger iphone 6 screen (which is still smaller than my current screen!)."
997,Good. That's the one I'll be getting. 
998,IMO all the 4 inch iPhones are way too small screen wise. The 6 seems like the perfect size to me so as long as they keep that around in addition to the small screen to have options for everyone I'll be fine with it. 
999,"If I can get a phone the same size as my 5s, I will. I have big hands, but I can't comfortably reach anywhere on the phone with the 6 or 6+.

...but if the specs aren't up to par with the newest models, I wouldn't get it."
1000,"so does this mean 
iPhone 6s,
iPhone 6 plus s,
iPhone 6c,
iPhone 6 plus c,
iPhone 6 mini,
iPhone 6s mini?"
1001,I hope so. This was an idea I had when I got my 6 from a 4s. A super slick small apple phone would be soooo sick.  Super low pro. About it! Got stoked when I saw this. 
1002,"I hope they don't because then it's a matter of time before people go ""4""?? I want the original 3.5""!! Then released is the iPhone 8 Micro. Then people want sizes in between, and then bigger than the plus and so on. 

Whats the issue with this? Look at Samsung, I have fucking clue that any of their product lines are or who they are for. They have every combination of screen size, camera pixels, flip, touch, candy bar ect. It ruins the brand image and you lose a lot of money on extra equipment to make the damn things. Then also the Genius bar will have their work cut out servicing all the things and then just maybe the idea of getting a phone serviced within the hour is not possible. 

I like the clean simple product categories and even now it's getting a bit too big. "
1003,"Get rid of the bezels and keep the 4.7"" screen. The first Moto X did it, and it's an extremely comfortable phone in hand. I do not need a sophisticated frame around the screen of my phone as it will only waste precious pocket space that women already struggle with. "
1004,"I hope they don't call it that... They've been really terrible at names lately. I'd prefer they just go the route the car industry has and call their iOS devices ""2016 iPhone; 2016 iPad; 2016 iPhone Mini;"" etc."
1005,"Oh god. I don't know if I would love or hate Apple bringing back the 4-inch form right after I gave up all hope of one-handed use and bought an iPhone 6.

Apple, y u do dis?!"
1006,"Apple needs to make an iPhone that has the same foot print of iPhone 5 but accommodates a larger 4.5-4.7"" screen. I think that would be ideal"
1007,"My S5 is a little over a year old, got it when it was released.
If a slightly gimped successor to the 6 was released in that size then i would be a happy bunny in a year or twos time when i come to replace mine."
1008,"I'd buy it.

The new phones are too big for me, and my wife hates it because she can't use them with one hand."
1009,"I think it would be awesome if they kept the iPhone 6/6+ screen size and shrunk the top and bottom bezels. I know it would be a big design challenge but imagine having basically just a 4.7"" or 5.5"" screen."
1010,iPhone 6 Air
1011,"Tried a 6. Tried a Nexus 5. 

Nothing beats my 5S. It's so much nicer to be able to do everything with one hand. Nothing is use my phone for really benefits from .7"" enough to give up one handed usability. I was hoping after the 6 launched that Apple would come out with an updated 4"" model in 2015."
1012,Many people swear by it and they shall have it. Why not? 
1013,"I was surprised they didn't update the 4"" model alongside the bigger ones. 

They should simplify the line into two categories; iPhone and iPad. Three screen sizes. No bullshit. 32gb minimum. Everything on the same chipsets again.

* iPhone: 4"", 4.7"", 5.5""

* iPad: 4"", 7.9"", 9.7""

Rebrand the iPod touch as the iPad nano, add the optional data-only SIM slot. Done."
1014,"They should call it the ""iPhone 6 Minus""...but probably won't since it'll be a perceived negative connotation. I understand the ""mini"" naming iteration, but you just added ""Plus"", why not play off of it?"
1015,"I'm all for this rumor to be true. I do, however, take issue with the naming. Using ""mini"" looks and feels too ""Samsung-y"" and I feel it's a terrible idea. Let's hope they change that."
1016,[deleted]
1017,"This shitty naming system has got to stop.

"
1018,I think 4 inch is the perfect size for someone who wants to use it mostly as a phone. As a media and game machine not so much. I would prefer to have the 4 inch for work.
1019,"Very dumb rumor, will never happen."
1020,Absolutely never will happen.
1021,You're totally right. I got a 6 plus for the battery life but one handed use suffers greatly. And I live in a metropolitan area where one handed use outside walking around is important. Really wish there was some breakthrough in battery tech to give a 5s sized phone the same battery as a 6 plus. 
1022,"The one handed use really depends on the app... well at least for me. The biggest problem is the items in the navigation bar. Generally we don't use navbar items much except for the back button, which one can easily replicate using a swipe to right from the very left side (unless of course you are using Google apps)"
1023,"My wife did the same thing last week.  She has small hands, her Galaxy S3 was too big, so she picked the 5s because it was small enough to use with one hand.

Apple will be going in the wrong direction if they completely drop the 4"" screen line.  Not even Samsung has a phone that size, and there is still a large market of people that don't want a massive phone."
1024,"Yea it feels much more like a phone than a pocket computer. My sister is still on the 4s and using it just felt weird-- that said, it is SO MUCH more comfortable to hold and click. Steve was right about it being the perfect ergonomic size... I just am willing to sacrifice the comfort for that extra visual eye candy."
1025,"I know so many people who can't stand big phones. (especially women with small pocket books that won't fit a big phone). I actually think its a great idea to make a super solid, high feature but small phone. It will never be a large market release. Maybe a small production run since its a niche market. "
1026,"I used to feel that way. Then I went to an iPhone 5S after years of using 4.5-5"" phone. It only took me a few days to get used to it. I have no regrets. I don't miss having a mini tablet for a phone that took up too much room in a pair of shorts and required two hands to do most things. I'm done with that. A one-handed phone has proven far more convenient and I have a tablet, so I don't need to surf the internet for 8 hours a day on my phone or watch movies on it. "
1027,"Every f**ing thread.
Well. I also like a 50"" screen and couldn't stand a 4"" screen for watching movies with my friends. So I totally see applications for 7"" phones.

Some people still like practical things and I for one am happy to not use a giant flat screen TV for checking mails, showing coupons to the cashier, texting, checking wikipedia and listening to music while hurrying around."
1028,"Yeah,  two days ago I used my old iPhone 4 for the first time since I got my 6 and it was just so small, I was shocked."
1029,"You managed to use it extremely well. It only seems that way ""visually"" - your eyes have been used to a bigger screen obviously. But a 5s still runs circles around a 6 plus in terms of usability for those with average sized hands. "
1030,"This is exactly how I feel. I keep looking at my sister's phone, a 4"", and think ""gosh that's small"". That's-what-she-said-jokes aside, the size of the 6+ is genuinely awesome and practical (I use it to watch online tutorials of things which normally require a computer or iPad). Just, I know for a fact that most girls I've asked think it's too big to possibly use. "
1031,"> ""how did I ever manage to use this before"" small to me now.

Android user here... every time I get a new phone (generally slighter bigger than than the last) I ALWAYS look back and say that exact thing. They are not for everyone but the difference is night and day."
1032,"Why is this being downvoted? I had a very similar experience. I can still appreciate a 4"" phone for what it is (about as large as you can get while comfortably performing every task with one hand), but after making a jump from a 5s to a 6 Plus the 5s does feel tiny.

The two phones are just used in different ways. I went through a bit of growing pains with the 6 Plus because I tried to use it like I did with my 5s and got frustrated. With my 5s I could whip it out while walking and sipping a coffee and send messages to people, but when I would be sitting and using it I would wish I had an iPad or computer with me. Now with the 6 Plus I feel very comfortable sitting down and dedicating time with it to read articles, write things or play games.

An iPhone 6 Plus and Apple Watch combo will hopefully be the best of both worlds. "
1033,And so many Apple drones were telling Android users they were crazy and there was something innate about that size being perfect. 
1034,"Dude for real. You should see how I felt using my dad's 3.5"" iPhone 4 after using my 6+ for months. I felt like fucking Derek Zoolander."
1035,"I just got my iPhone 6 this week (after going from a 4 to a 5) and it's perfectly sized. I was looking at android 5 inchers and somehow those fractions of an inch seem to make it gargantuan comparatively. 

That being said, why go back to 4 inches? Weren't we all screaming for the size upgrade? I think the people who would be interested in that size would rather just a cheap android phone instead, knowing how uncompetitively Apple would price it. "
1036,"I agree.  I got an iPhone 6 on launch day and have been using it since then.  Recently unlocked my old iPhone 5 to test out T-Mobile's network and it's just so much easier to hold and use.  Yes, it's smaller.  Yes, I wanted a bigger screen and was excited to get it with the 6.  Now I'm kind of conflicted. :\"
1037,"I feel the exact same way, I was just complaining to my friend the other day. I have a 5C but if I could've gotten the 5C internals in the 4S's case that would have been my perfect phone. Honestly I also just love the design of the old iPhone 4s in general, with the sharp edges and flat sides."
1038,[deleted]
1039,Same here. This is the extact thing that would get me to upgrade my 4S.
1040,"The iPhone 6 didn't even get feature parity with the 6 Plus.

If there is a 6S mini, it may not get features that the 6S gets. Which itself could be lacking features that the 6S Plus has.

Then again, I could see the ""6S mini"" just being an iPhone 5S, but with the thinner design, protruding camera, and NFC added. It won't have the speed of the iPhone 6 or the (possible) 2GB RAM of the iPhone 6S.


"
1041,"Knowing Apple, probably 85% 'latest' feature parity."
1042,6 minus
1043,So you don't like the large screen?
1044,[removed]
1045,"The 5C is low end of the iPhone range, but not really a low end phone. Low end phones generally cost less than $100 US for a non-contract phone (Prepaid/Pay as you go, or regular service)."
1046,"Agreed, wish they had done this with the iPads as well this year."
1047,"Or you could, you know, buy both phones and just transfer your sim card."
1048,A 4 inch ipad?
1049,You answer your own question and then ask it again. Why?
1050,iPhone 6c is the most likely I think. 
1051,"Makes sense but you're right I doubt anyone would want something called ""minus"""
1052,"iPod mini, iPod nano, Mac mini, iPad mini

They've had this naming convention for a while."
1053,"The iPhone 6 is their primary device. The iPhone 6 has a 4.7"" screen size. The 6 Plus is even bigger, so your statement is factually incorrect."
1054,"I mean, the reason Apple took so long to release a bigger phone was because they knew it would eliminate one-handed use. They were kinda forced to enter the bigger screen market because of competitors, namely Samsung. If anyone realizes the importance of being able to use your phone with one hand, it's Apple. I'd actually be surprised if they didn't release another 4"" phone.

Edit: Also, an easy fix to increase battery life would be to just make the phone a little bit thicker. They'll never do that, though."
1055,They probably want you to buy an Apple Watch.
1056,"Ive been saying since they released, I wished they went with a 5-5.2"" size. Ive had the 6 and the 6+ and find myself liking both for different reasons...wish i could have the best of both."
1057,It also isn't as slick as the 6+ which is my main gripe about. Sometimes it feels like it'll slip right out of your hands. 
1058,In tech savvy but still love the 4s. I find I'm not using my phone much for watching videos or high performance gaming so this form factor is still perfect for now. I really hope they support a smaller form factor for the future. 
1059,"It's usability, rather than just eye candy only.

Sure, you can get by on a 3.5"" screen, but it's not a particularly nice thing to use. Especially if you've been spoiled by using something with a 5 - 6"" display.

Being able to 'get by' has never been a sign of greatness.

I could 'get by' with a 14"" black and white TV in my house too, but would I want to? Obviously not."
1060,"My dad is one of those who needs a small phone. It's got to fit in his pocket comfortably and he climbs scaffolds all day in construction. He also doesn't like ""large phones"" in general, but he complained going from the iPhone 4S to the 5S in terms of size (it was alright after a while, though) but said that my LG G2 (e.g. iphone 6 size) would be way too large.

I really hope they have a 4"" screen by the time his company rolls out upgrades or he'll be stuck with a phone he hates."
1061,[deleted]
1062,"I'd consider it. That 4"" phone just feels great in the hand."
1063,"You're absolutely right. Unfortunately I got a 6 plus for the battery life. If there could be a 5s or even a 6 with a 6 plus' battery life, I'd be all over it. Also hoping that the watch will help in regards to not being able to use my 6 plus one handed as much as I'd like. "
1064,"It totally depends on you're usage. Some people are out and about, or like to watch a movie on their phone, or do a lot of web browsing which a larger screen is much better for.

And some people only use their phone for calls and texts, and maybe a tiny bit of web browsing and just don't need or want a big phone.

But then why bother with a smart phone of all you do is make calls and texts. You can get over a weeks battery life out of a dumb phone. For people who only make calls and texts, having an iPhone is purely an image thing.

Pretty much most smart features benefit from having a 5 or 6 inch screen."
1065,[deleted]
1066,IMO because he's saying managing to use the 5s is difficult yet it's actually way easier than a 6 plus. He's solely talking about the visual experience without giving credit to the superior usability of a device you're supposed to carry with you all the time in every situation including those where you might only be able to use it with one hand. 
1067,"It *is* ""perfect"". That size has superior usability over a 6 plus."
1068,"> Weren't we all screaming for the size upgrade?

No?"
1069,"Partly because of profit margins. There's no way we will see the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus as the ""free"" iPhone in two years. One option is to just make a plastic iPhone 6. If there is enough interest in a smaller iPhone, however, that's another option. 

Also, it doesn't make sense for Apple to increase the size of the iPod Touch, IMO. If that's how Apple sees it as well, then they will remain committed to supporting the 4"" screen size. And in that case, pushing a 4"" iPhone could help maintain higher profit margins for the iPod Touch, and vice versa. 

Just a couple thoughts. "
1070,"Yup, same here. But I got a 6 plus. Way too crappy to use one handed. But the bigger screen looks nice I suppose. Given its supposed to be an ultra portable pocketable device physical usability should come first. However, the battery life is main reason I got it. "
1071,"I was one of the people saying they would love the huge screen if the 6 Plus.  I got one, used it for a few weeks, and could not get used to it.  What I realized is that I am a one handed user most of the time and would like to continue doing that.  The Plus also felt ridiculous when I was making a call.  The sound from the earpiece was always soft because I could;t quite get the placement right on my ear and people said my voice was softer...presumably because the microphone was further away from my mouth.  I took it back and exchanged it for a 6.  Much better.  But, I recognize my needs are different from some others.  People seem to really like it.  I just couldn't get used to it.  If I want a big screen, I will watch on my television or my Macbook Air."
1072,"Yup 3.5"" was the best IMO. "
1073,"> iPhone 6S  
> iPhone 7

Both 4 syllables."
1074,lol
1075,"Huh? The #s lines always have all the features of the previous # model. 

I remember a quite from an Apple exec talking about how they're extra careful with new technology because unlike competitors, if they add a feature, customers expect that same feature to be there in future iterations, meaning they have less ""let's try it and see if sticks"" room to mess around with."
1076,"No, it's a lot harder to use one-handed. (Especially since it's thinner and slicker, too, and thus harder to grasp.)"
1077,I wouldn't. The screen pops off of those fuckers all the time. Plastic just doesn't hold things in place very well because it gives one way or the other just enough to need to re-seat the display. 
1078,Yes. What they currently call the iPod touch. Functionally it's better categorized with the iPad than with the iPhone.
1079,Isn't the point of asking a question to debate the answers?
1080,"You're probably correct, but I think if they go the 6c route the ""new"" 4-inch form would have to retain the plastic colored backing that the 5c had, otherwise I think they'd risk looking extremely inconsistent."
1081,"Indeed. Was a quick ""shower-thought"" type of comment. Don't think they'll actually call it that, but rather thought of it as a clever way to counter balance the ""plus"" naming iteration they just introduced."
1082,"That's actually a good point, I hadn't initially thought of it. Now I'm reconsidering my opinion."
1083,"The 6 is their flagship phone not the primary device, the the 4"" screens have a very long way to go and only a fool would think Apple has now dropped only to be ""considering"" a return. They won't return because they never went anywhere."
1084,"I mean the 6 works well in one hand for me. I do have large hands but still feel like they don't need to make anything smaller than the 5, 5s, or 5c. Even now when I pick one of those up and look at the screen it feels tiny."
1085,"they have to reduce the damned bezel. Apple's 4.7 inch phone is the size of 5"" phone."
1086,"The 6+ is ridiculously slippery.  Didn't the first customer drop theirs on live TV?

If some kind of no-slip texture isn't introduced for the 6S, I'll be very surprised (and/or peeved at Apple)."
1087,"I can imagine the ""c"" series (if it continues) to carry the torch. I agree with you completely though-- it's comfortable to use especially if you're not big on media consumption."
1088,"Usability? Nah-- most apps on my iPhone 6+ display exactly the same information as someone else's iPhone 5 or even iPhone 4.

I mean, it took Google like THIS WEEK to update G+ to 6+ resolution, and maybe a week before that for their search app-- and the apps are literally identical, except higher resolution. There's no usability difference, as much as we may try to convince ourselves to justify the bigger screen purchase.

It's closer to the difference between a 30 inch 720p TV to a 55 inch 1080p-- it's nicer looking, but it's not changing how you use it."
1089,Everyone says a larger phone than what they currently have is too large. I kept saying it with every screen size increase. Now when I go back I always think how did I ever survive with such a small screen.
1090,"I'm sorry to say man, but the niche is pretty small. The reason Apple sold the majority of those phones wasn't because people liked the form size, but because there's an Apple logo on the back of the phone. Just look at the sales for the new generation of phones, people obviously don't care for the size of the phone. "
1091,"I agree 100%. If I had to pick one thing I do not like about my 5S, it's the battery life. I bought a Mophie juice pack case right away and that more than solved my problem, but it adds a lot of mass to the phone. I can't imagine how anyone could deal with one of these phones without a battery case like this, I'd be charging it constantly and I use my phone less than a lot of people I know. "
1092,"I don't disagree that a larger screen makes it easier to use a smartphone in a lot of ways. I've just reached a point where, while I still use many smartphone features. I just discovered that the small sacrifices that come with giving up 1/2-1"" of screen size are worth it for me.  

I don't have my face in my phone for hours and hours everyday like a lot of people (but I still need smartphone features). For someone like me, it's nicer not to have to carry a phone the size of a roof tile in my pocket wherever I go and have to drop everything and stop and use both hands and give the phone my full attention any time I need to interact with it. "
1093,"But no one is upset they're making those bigger phones. It's when they abandon their smaller phones and leave customers with tiny hands unable to use a phone that's too big that we're complaining about.

Honestly, the sizing of the 6 made me consider looking elsewhere for a phone, something I never thought I'd do because I love my iPhones, but I can't have a phone I can't use. If they release a smaller phone, I'll upgrade. If not, I'm hanging onto my 5 until new iOSes are no longer supported."
1094,"Fair enough, now how about why I've been downvoted now? I just figured that I could relate to the view they took that after using a 6 Plus a 5s feels small. I don't know if it came off differently. "
1095,"Weird, I guess that that one guy must have gone out and bought like a billion of them after they released it."
1096,"> Partly because of profit margins. There's no way we will see the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus as the ""free"" iPhone in two years.

The 6 not the 6+ would be the ""free"" (~$450) iPhone in two years, and I don't see any difficulties with that and maintaining healthy profits. The current $650 iPhone 6 has a $200 BOM - figure that will fall to ~$150 in 2 years yielding Apple about the same margin they have today."
1097,"Exactly. Also, in my opinion they should have made the 4"" (if they just *had* to have it) wider... not taller. It seems too streched for my taste. That's why I'm still on my iPhone 4. A 3.5"" option for new models would be my christmas gift."
1098,True. I guess my fist language has betrayed me.
1099,"My point was the 'budget' model, even if announced/released concurently, never has the all 100% of the tech included in the flagship model."
1100,Not with regards to the app store.  The ipad is considered a tablet.  Apps are custom programmed for the tablet screens.  In that regard the ipod is closer to the iphone.
1101,The iPod touch is basically discontinued at this point
1102,"Why not, actually. There would probably be a redesign but also in plastic. I don't think they would have put it in production for only one iterarion. "
1103,I agree.  The 6 seems to still be a one handed phone.  I said in another comment that I realized I am a one handed user most of the time and exchanged my Plus for a 6.  Seems to be MUCH better for me.
1104,"Yeah, thats true...the Note 4 has a 5.7"" screen and is smaller overall than the Plus. The home/touch ID button is taking too much space, then they want the forehead to match the chin."
1105,"That was in my city! Perth, Australia, he dropped a 6 but it was just getting it out of the box.   
Still, you're not wrong, I held onto my 6 with an iron grip until I could get a case for it."
1106,Yeah an Aussie dude with shaky hands was opening his live on morning tv and face planted it. Not sure if it was a 6 or 6+ though. 
1107,Poor guy never even touched it. It slid out of the box when he opened it. 
1108,"It does if the apps are updated to take advantage of it.

Here's one little example of what I mean: Even if they're not optimised for the bigger screen, which more and more apps will be, you can much more comfortably browse full desktop web sites without needing to zoom in etc. So it's making the task of web browsing easier, and less of a pain in the ass. That's more than just eye candy for the sake of eye candy. Yes I'm not saying you can't browse on a 3.5"" screen. I'm saying that if you do do a lot of web browsing, it's shit."
1109,"My dad's quite different, though. He knows exactly what he wants, and where he's willing to budge on. He has an 8"" tablet, a laptop, he's used desktops a-plenty, and several different phones. When he says the current iPhone 5s is about as large as he would go (dimensionally speaking) he actually means it.

The difference is that for you (I presume) a phone is an entertainment device, and an information device more than a phone. For him it's primarily a phone, and a gps, and he uses it one handed the *vast* majority of the time. It's a tool, nothing more, and so he doesn't like it being larger than what it is now. I'm the same way, but my particular limit is my LG G2 just from personal preference."
1110,"This is really only true of people looking at smartphones as pocket computers. My dad, for instance, absolutely considers his 3GS to be nothing more than a means to call people and read email and absolutely hates even my 5s. I think he'd switch to a flip phone before accepting anything much bigger than what he's got."
1111,"I've met many people who hate the size of the 6, and yes I'm one of them. I was due for an upgrade and passed it up *solely due to the fact that it was too big.* I like the look, functionality, etc., but it was awkward to use and impractical to carry around. This isn't that uncommon of a complaint. I hear it frequently."
1112,"Lol, he's real bitter because you're right. Then you get down voted? Classic apple sub. 

"
1113,"And that's why it's nice that smartphones come in many shapes (slightly), and sizes. Different strokes for different folks. :-)"
1114,"> But no one is upset they're making those bigger phones. It's when they abandon their smaller phones and leave customers with tiny hands unable to use a phone that's too big that we're complaining about.

Welcome to the situation we have at /r/Android for years. So many companies were laser-focused on building nothing but large phones, that when one comes out with a small phone that *isn't* hobbled to shit (e.g. 2013 Moto X, Z3C), it's seen as somewhat of a celebration. The community isn't that much better, as many of us get downvotes for merely saying ""we don't like large phones"".

I'm disgusted at that sub's infatuation with large thin phones. The latest fad involves having less than 5mm thickness. As if the ergonomics of a large phone in relation to one-handed use couldn't get any worse, along comes the need to make the phone so thin, that its handling (not to mention battery life and whatnot) is severely degraded - all in the name of style."
1115,Or maybe it's just that a lot of people don't care if the phone is 4 or 4.7 inches and would have bought it either way?
1116,"You may be right, but I believe this issue is coming up because the 5c is being phased out next year, and Apple needs to decide what to do to take its place over the next two years, what the product should be called, etc. So next year it might contain the 5s internals, and they could give it the awkward name 5sc or whatever. But then, the following year's model becomes critical for deciding what to do with that product category.

It makes sense for Apple to ""consider"" maintaining a 4"" iPhone, since it's a reasonable option. They probably are also considering not doing that.

But most speculation suggests that, in order to reap the benefits of setting up a new production line for the 5c, Apple would need to continue to make a plastic iPhone for a while longer. "
1117,"Yup, I've had my 5C for almost a year now and it has never stopped looking goofy/awkward to me. The aspect ratio is just a weird shape. Only reason I got it was because my 4 finally died on me, otherwise I probably would've waited to get a 6. I don't necessarily love the bigger screen but at least it is the right shape.

Also, a lot of apps just don't fit right on the 5-style screen."
1118,"I think that would be the case if it becomes a iPhone 6C, compared to the features of the iPhone 6S, since the past generation iPhone 5c was a slight upgrade to the iPhone 5."
1119,"Mmm, a valid point. The iPod touch really is in a weird category by itself."
1120,"Yea it's really in a weird place. Stick a data-only cellular option in it and you've wiped out what remains of the standalone GPS market. But then you also cut into the iPhone bottom end.

"
1121,"I honestly can't wait for apps to start taking advantage of it, though I'm a bit skeptical of what they can come up with.

For example, I've been on a galaxy S4 before switching to iPhone (thank god to be rid of touch wiz), and most of the android apps haven't done anything with the bigger screen even though larger screens have been around android phones for some time. The only thing that had been a saving grace on all the androids is really just the Galaxy note 4, which lets you use SOME apps side by side. It's not a game changer for me personally but at least it's trying. Aside from that I haven't seen any real progress-- not that I blame them, it's hard to build an app that predicts a 6 inch screen when there are floods of devices at the 4 inch level. Such is life as an android dev.

I think what apple has been trying to do with the base iPhone 6+ apps is on the right direction (the sidebar on landscape view thing, for example), but as a whole there are few apps that has taken advantage of it. For things like web browsing having more on the same screen is nice, but if you forced me to go back to a smaller screen I don't think I would use it differently. It's like the smaller TV bigger tv example: it's nice and I'm used to it now so the smaller seems uncomfortable, but it hasn't changed the way I consume information the way the iPad has, for example."
1122,I also skipped this generation. Always upgrade every two years. iPhone 5 is working well enough to keep it. 
1123,"Nope. From what i've read this time round Apple is doing record sales, so there must be a reason for it."
1124,"Umm, iPhone 6 has the same aspect ratio as iPhone 5?"
1125,"Not only that, but in my opinion it's just perfect. Perfect size for one handed use, and yet the screen isn't too small. I don't *want* a new phone because there isn't one that's better for me. If they keep the dimensions and upgrade the specs, great, but my phone does everything I want and need it to do."
1126,They have record sales every year. 
1127,"It can't be the sleekness or upgraded internal hardware...

That being said, having a bigger phone allowed them to draw people from android that wanted a bigger phone, but that doesn't mean no one prefers a smaller phone. I'm not buying a 6. I'll hang onto my 5 until its dying day but after that, I'm buying a phone that fits in my hand and my pocket."
1128,I suspect this is because lots of people were using iPhone 4s and this year is the year that those phones are now unsupported.
1129,Really? I thought the six was closer to a golden rectangle. I've only used my friend's 6+
1130,Keeley Mag Echo is pretty solid for the size/price.
1131,Depends on what you mean by small form factor. Two of my favorites would be the El Cap and SA Nemesis. But some might still consider them too large.
1132,"These days:


The Nux NDD7. Believe the hype"
1133,"I'm not sure that I know the best, but it sounds like you would like the El Cap."
1134,"What about the Catalinbread Echorec, which i believe is modeled after the Binson Echorec? The Belle Epoch is the original small-form version (the deluxe being a double foot switch and probably not what you want)."
1135,I have the RE-2 and an Empress Tape Delay. Both are good. I think the Empress has more tone but the RE-2 is stereo.
1136,"dunlop echoplex! it has an external tap tempo jack and can do clean or modulated repeats, three knobs and stupid easy to use. got some dip switches inside too, plus it’s the size of any standard MXR pedal, it’s kind of cool having the official echoplex branding on it as well"
1137,Catalinbread Echorec.  Just phenomenal.  Sometimes I have it AND Belle Epoch Deluxe on my board.  They just nail those tape delay and preamp sounds.
1138,"For me, Dawner Prince Boonar is #1 in sound per square cm."
1139,"I think the Empress Tape delay is smaller than the volante.

I have the volante, now RE-202, Empress echo system and Empress superdelay (Vintage).

TBH I should have never sold the Empress Tape delay."
1140,tc flashback - the thing rules and is a great price
1141,"Sounds like an el cap is the obvious move.  It’ll give you similar sounds, more detail in specific tape parameters and is smaller.  If you’re looking for something else entirely, I think the Dunlop echo plex is a great unit, and I think one of the better options available.  The external tap thing sucks, but sound wise, it’s great.  It’s been a bit, but tape to tape between it and the volante, I think the Dunlop won.  I have the volante because it was much more versatile and the added features you’re trying to get away from :)"
1142,"I love my El Cap, Belle Epoch Deluxe is amazing as well, although a little big, and I really like the new Nux Tape Delay my buddy has. Mag Echo is probably the best for the money"
1143,Willing to trade my flint plus a twinbender for that volante
1144,"I've not tried nearly enough to feel confident in picking a ""best,"" but I do really like my Keeley Eccos, and it's among the few compact tape-style delays I know of that have tap tempo FWIW. Would really love to try an RE-2 though, because the tape sounds in my DD-500 are probably my favorite of anything I have—obviously a gigantic pedal in comparison though."
1145,My Nux Tape Core Deluxe is very nice
1146,I love my NUX NDD7..
1147,"Catalinbread Belle Epoch. The delay repeats sound airy and ethereal, and they sit well in the mix. No tap tempo but I’ve made do without it."
1148,Ehx canyon
1149,"I really like the Wampler Faux Tape Echo v2.   
The Keeley Halo is something I would look at if you want a bit more than a straightforward delay but much simpler than the Volante."
1150,r/letstradepedals for trading the Volante 🤘
1151,The recent Andy Timmons’ one.
1152,"If you want the most realistic Space Echo sound in a compact form factor, the RE-2 is the best."
1153,The strymon el capistan is just a tape delay and it’s much smaller
1154,Can’t beat it for the size price. The Mag echo is the delay side of the caverns and it sounds godly.
1155,"I second the Eccos—it’s my favorite delay, it can do those self oscillations, it has a looper, presets. 

The price of v1 El Caps is coming down and I’ve long been tempted but then I look at my board and think “why bother?”"
1156,I think this is all-time low for this case. Crazy deal if you like it.
1157,[Additional $10 off if you purchase through PayPal](https://imgur.com/a/8eNwYlV)
1158,In for one. Now just waiting for that $65 Intel i3-13100F deal to come back.
1159,This is an absolute steal. that’s it.
1160,"I built two systems in these when they were $120, they are easy to build in but the psu cables are pretty ridged"
1161,FYI these might take a bit to ship. Ordered mine on the 4th and nothing so far.
1162,"Dam, really want to make an office living room PC build out of this thing"
1163,"Damn when I built my ITX PC 3 years ago I paid $180 just for my SFX PSU


Seems like a great deal lol"
1164,"I have this case and I can say it’s awesome. Cpu thermals are slightly better when it’s on its side as opposed to being vertical whereas gpu doesn’t care.

Otherwise super satisfying build with a 280mm aio in such a small footprint. 

Oh and some people report that the cpu 8-pin cable is too short to reach the eps header on their mobo, I personally had no problems with it but you can route it under the mobo for a bit extra slack!"
1165,Anybody know what the size limit is on GPU's for this case?
1166,"Ordered this, great little case, but my model’s handle mechanism broke immediately so I had to return. Wish it worked out, but ended up going with the NR200 instead

Check Amazon for this as well. They’ll usually have the Adorama store and have better shipping for a couple bucks more"
1167,Damn I just bought the NR200 for the 9.99 price on Amazon. But I still need a PSU. How do the cases compare?
1168,This will my next case soon. No way I can pass on this price with a sfx PSU.
1169,"Bought, no questions asked. I've been WAITING for it to drop lower than 8 months ago when I posted this exact one for $129.99.

Time to start saving up for some components I guess"
1170,"Love this case, have it in white"
1171,"Thanks OP. Picked one up. Went for the black colorway. Used the ""white"" for a friend's kid's build recently and just couldn't jive with the color. It was more of an off-white. It didn't necessarily look bad on its own, but placing it next to any other white case or component really highlighted the color difference."
1172,"Would it be troll to buy this case now for a build I'm planning in the winter in like 5 months? This seems like a pretty cool case, small form factor, handle, fits big gpu, etc, but buying a case and psu months in advance when a better deal might show up or a different case I like more might come around"
1173,"I have an unfinished A4-H2O project in hand and another nr200 plan on the way (yes $10 is an insane price). 

And now I just purchased another one I have no idea what to do with. Cheers."
1174,Unless my address is set to something erroneous shipping says it's 78.45 and starting for me
1175,Tempting to just get a PSU since I ordered that Cooler Master ITX a week ago
1176,If I can find an itx lga 1700 Mobo on sale to actually pair with this I might bite....
1177,"Question for anyone with this case: is it possible to remove the PSU shroud and put a mATX motherboard in this case? At 9.9"" long a 9.6"" mATX motherboard should fit if I rigged up a new mounting plate. The idea would be to fit the components into it kind of like the new [NCASE Freeflow](https://www.caselabs.org/cases/freeflow)."
1178,What about that psu quality? I have been looking for it but cant find the full specs.
1179,Yah I think this is all-time low...been eyeing this case for some time damn you OP
1180,It’s crazy to get a 700W SFX for 109 and getting the case for free.
1181,Well damn... it's hard to even find a decent SFX power supply for this price
1182,This sealed the deal
1183,Yo where do you get this offer?
1184,Was this a targeted email offer?
1185,"Hope yours shipped by now, ordered yesterday got shipping email today"
1186,"I have mine as an htpc. She's a beast, especially with the OLED tv."

1189,Link??
1190,Damn how did you get it that
1191,"Tough question, you're going to hit Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Christmas even if you don't get it at this price point it won't cost that much more. Personally, I would wait it out if you know for sure you won't complete the build till then."
1192,User name checks out
1193,"I love this case. It was a fun build. The usb-c pass through is annoying and the bottom-I/O is frustrating whenever I need to access it, but after the first few weeks I rarely need to access the bottom I/O."
1194,The SFF enthusiast sacrificed for us to reach this point. Now us plebs can enjoy tight spaces too.
1195,I imagine many small form factor enthusiasts might find it tempting just to buy this to rip the PSU out of it lol
1196,Honestly I'm thinking of upgrading my SFX PSU from 550W to 700W but I may just buy this and swap the PSU's. Although then I'd need to do a second build lol
1197,"It may have been targeted, received the email this morning around 7am central time"
1198,Yep it shipped today too!
1199,would this be 335mm and triple slot? I have a quad slot that measures 335~6 but it's reasonably more thick on the PCI front.
1200,Yeah I think im gonna wait it out. Thanks
1201,I just purchased one for the price with included PSU I will tilt the case as many times as it takes to access the I/O. What cooler are you using in yours?
1202,Giggity?
1203,"Must be, I'm only seeing 2% cashback on Paypal"
1204,"Yup. Triple slot. [Pcpartpicker listing](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/BWmmP6/hyte-revolt-3-mini-itx-tower-case-w700-w-power-supply-cs-hyte-revolt3-bp), [Tom's Hardware build review](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/hyte-revolt-3-review)."
1205,Holding inventory sucks a lot. Definitely buy when you need it unless you 100% know you want it
1206,"CoolerMaster ml280 mirror. 280mm AIO. It’s a tight fit, and it took some effort to figure out what direction I could orient it. Got it cheap last year."
1207,"I'm skeptic because there is no drawback communicated aside from the low FOV, so it will probably be a get hype and be disappointed at launch type of deal.No idea about the battery life, can't actually expect it to run applications without a computer at that size, weight and resolution. Not sure if wireless streaming from PC works well.Something about it is gonna be shitty I'm pretty sure, might also be controllers and/or tracking. I don't believe in unicorns."
1208,"200g is incredible light compared to Quest at 500, great for consuming media if not for games...

looks like there are/will be 2 options of the headset:

The **arpara VR** headset weights 200g, 1/3 of a typical VR headset, has 95° FOV and 120Hz refresh rate. It can be connected to phones, computers, and game consoles. Together with a 6DoF position tracking kit completes a PC VR gaming setup.

The **arpara all-in-one VR** headset weights 380g, has inside-out 6DoF head and hand tracking, runs on Qualcomm XR2 platform that is capable of driving 6 concurrent cameras, 11 times AI processing power, supports 8K video. Other specs include a 4600mA high-capacity battery, 95° FOV, 90Hz refresh rate, and support wired and wireless streaming to play Steam VR.

*(from yahoo news)*"
1209,The title is inaccurate. The **tethered** version of it is 200g with 3DOF. The **standalone** version like in the title weight at **380g**.
1210,"I can see formfactor going in this direction. But not yet. There are more important metrics to solve before making it smaller. Like price, battery, fov, varifocal, face/eye/body tracking, resolution, onboarding etc. The list very long.

And if you want to break into the standalone space, you need a store that can compete with Oculus or Steam. Its a HUGE bar to pass. Impossible for most."
1211,"There is nothing ""next generation"" about 95°FOV."
1212,"I don’t think I care at all about this thing being 5k or having good clarity if they are going to make the fov that small in today’s gen of headsets, 95 is just way to small for me, considering what’s advertised is always more than what it actualy can do."
1213,"I love how all people are complaining about the FOV, when this falls right in line with the Quest 2’s FOV."
1214,"95 degree FOV sounds like ass, NGL."
1215,"We need more FOV not less. FOV is one of the most important immersion aspects with current technology, along with good colour reproduction, so the OLED nets them some points."
1216,Form factor is the least important thing I think for a VR headset when the trade offs are so large.
1217,You need a headset that's so comfortable you can sleep in it. Bonus points if the AR features are so good you never have to take it off.
1218,Anything out to compete with the Quest 2 I'll applaud and champion.
1219,Would want a higher FOV
1220,"- Will this be next gen?

Only if they can up that crazy low FOV."
1221,"The form factor is already sufficient. What we need are good lenses. I noticed this when I happened upon my PC while in VR. I was almost shocked at how clear everything looked. I'm on a Quest 1 but it's so blurry in comparison that VR seems only fit for exercise type games where you're not focused on the graphics.

The form factor can stay the same, we needed lenses. The only time I've heard of a veteran VR person getting their mind blown is from better lenses."
1222,I can't go from a 130 degree fov to a 95 degree fov.
1223,I'm more enraptured by the idea of Mechwarrior in VR....*sigh*
1224,"Its missing a headstrap though. Add 100 grams and it'll feel so much better, its not all about mass when talking about how heavy a headset feels. I know this sounds pedantic but if there's no headstrong I'd 100% not buy it, it'll just keep falling down my face unless its super tight

Its like they removed one of the very most important comfort parts so they could say its lighter and let people assume that's more comfortable.."
1225,I'm interested in the reviews. But from my experience with advertised FOV. 95 will likely be obtained by a small few.
1226,"95 degree fov kind of ruins it tbh. 600 dollars to basically have a flat screen in front of your face? terrible deal. for around 200 dollars more you could get 200 degrees fov 8k with the pimax vision 8k plus. on the other hand, i like the lighter weight, definitely a huge step forward."
1227,I heard Apple will come out with their VR and it will be very big end.
1228,"How can I buy this, I need headset to view my vuze xr camera videos"
1229,We will see in 2 years. ..
1230,"The bulk of the Quest 2 comes from the battery and cooling system. It could be slightly smaller if they didn't use LCD panels, but not by much. I'm just going to go out and say it, this standalone version will never exist as a consumer product."
1231,Yes it will and can't come soon enough. Same for microled monitors instead of miniled or backlit cruft.
1232," is this ""Pimax"" all over again?"
1233,I don't think so.
1234,I mean… I’ll believe it when I see it
1235,Their prototype hands-on videos lack the 4 tracking cameras shown in promotional images. Wouldn't be surprised if it's all vaporware and is just a cheap personal 3D viewer with a 3D-printed shell.
1236,"Definitely skeptical, but if it does actually lack a top headstrap, and is comfortable, that's a big plus for me.  Not enough of a draw though if the experience isn't as good."
1237,Yikes that looks extremely uncomfortable
1238,"More importantly, can I use it with the Facebook spy machine?"
1239,I'm ready for one of these tiny headsets.  F cumbersome VR.
1240,That FOV though.
1241,i picked up my phone today and weighed it. it was 200g. Damn
1242,"hopefully the compactness doesn't negatively impact performance. i'm looking forward to more reviews of this, then i'll cop it in time for my most anticipated game."
1243,Im looking forward to the all in one version with 6 cameras.  This will be my first VR
1244,"Not to mention the store. If it’s standalone it’ll have its own store, which will probably be limited."
1245,"This device will be half baked and suck, imo, *but* it's a great insight into microLED tech and where it will allow VR to go so I'm still excited to see it but I have no intentions of buying this specific device."
1246,"Battery is probably in the back of the head trap like the Neo 2/3 Pro have

The main drawback on basically any standalone is going to be shitty software though, both the user experience and the tracking quality"
1247,[removed]
1248,"The reviews will be very interesting for sure. Quest 2 is not particularly good at PCVR, so it will be interesting to see how new headsets compete with it, especially for wireless. So many people are itching to ditch Facebook as soon as a viable alternative appears. If its not a lemon, I could see this being a decent Quest 2 competitor with the form factor being a big upside for certain people. It is a hard sell though especially with the true next gen of VR on the horizon."
1249,"In comparison, the Valve Index is 809 grams (and IMO less comfortable due to this than the OG Oculus Rift) and the HP G2 is 500 grams. 

200 grams would be a complete game changer."
1250,"> 11 times AI processing power

What is this?"
1251,200g is less than my xiaomi phone
1252,120hz is only for 1080 resolution according to their site.
1253,True. but at least the compute unit and battery are in the back. the Quest 2 is 510 g ALL in the front. This will be 200g in the front
1254,"Actually often times the shrinking process that brings the cost efficiencies because it usually relies on highly engineered, highly specific components that may be fairly easy to mass produce.  With mass production comes cost savings.  Just because we've seen cool technologies doesn't mean they are the future.  People need to stop thinking that the next product MUST have this or its garbage.  The next product will be the one the masses are impressed enough with to buy, that may not be very impressive to you."
1255,"I guess it has micro OLED displays and 95degree FOV.

No idea how it tracks."
1256,"I heavily disagree. Some people (like myself) cant play VR anymore because of neck pain. All those other issues you listed are trivial compared to that (except maybe the store, but they can always hook up to Steam)"
1257,"Any standalone can just use steam, that's not a problem. The reason Oculus has their own store is mainly because Facebook want all the data for themselves as the Quest is primarily a data gathering device. But you can use Steam for Quest 2 with wireless PCVR."
1258,The oculus store is low key crap
1259,I think we will see another headset in roughly this form factor on the 28th of October.
1260,"None of that is mutually exclusive though. What will actually happen is each VR headset company is going to have their niche. So, some companies will focus on this smaller form factor, some on fov, some on lenses, some on displays, so on. These will all be band wagon type companies too, with low overhead. A business can be made like this, it just won't be the market leader. These companies know and accept this as part of their business plan.

To be the leader in tech, or life in general, you need to be doing stuff your competition can't. Developing new technology is the way to do it, most of the time. What VR company is doing research at the level of Facebook? None that I know. Valve to some degree."
1261,"> I can see formfactor going in this direction. But not yet. There are more important metrics to solve before making it smaller. Like price, battery, fov, varifocal, face/eye/body tracking, resolution, onboarding etc. The list very long.

Not all of those have anything to do with the weight of the unit. Battery of course, FOV and varifocal likely depending on the solution, resolution though not at all. Price doesn't need to be higher and more tracking sensors don't necessarily will increase the weight noticeably.

> And if you want to break into the standalone space, you need a store that can compete with Oculus or Steam. Its a HUGE bar to pass. Impossible for most.

To be fair, this seems at least compatible with Steam VR when coupled with a PC."
1262,"Steam doesn't have a standalone headset in any shape or form though, does it? 

However when the wired version of this is compared to the index it has some truly massive upgrades.

I don't really agree with the sentiment of what your going for, and I find it worth pointing out this is a Chinese headset, and is also meant to compete in a completely different ecosystem, the fact that steam VR is supported in and of itself is a very big deal. 

Also all of those major features you've described don't even exist in 95% of available headsets, it sounds like your trying to shoot the arpara in the foot based on competition that doesn't even exist yet."
1263,"True, I would also prefer improvements in those other aspects, but there are already many other companies working on that and I don't think it's a zero-sum game. I think it's natural that as VR grows we should expect headsets to further diversify to cover a variety of needs and interests, from lower fidelity but sleek, portable goggles, to bulky but photo-realistic super-haptic powerhouses. I remain skeptical of what this specific headset can deliver but I think it's a good sign for VR as a whole."
1264,"Standard VR displays are usually 2-3"" but microdisplays typically are around 1"" making it harder to get a wide FOV.  Need to employ some lens trickery to get bigger FOVs or make larger displays"
1265,Maybe playing Beat Saber at half the weight is more next gen to some people than wearing a giant headset with a wide FOV.
1266,"A person who knows exactly what he or she is writing, unlike others. Thx."
1267,Its because of their religion to FB. Quest 2 cons only exist for other HMDs.
1268,"Index has 108 degrees and everyone was raving how big it was. Both CV1 and Rift S had 88, so 95 while not ideal is definitely not ass, especially from a tiny device."
1269,That's what I've been saying all along.  The Quest 2's FOV sounds like ass.  Haven't tried it though.  Might be worth it if it were in a form factor that matters.
1270,"I don't agree cause most headsets right now (especially the high FOV focused Pimax) don't really benefit from large FOV. Not only that it costs more GPU performance, the small sweet spot and fairly bad e2e clarity of fresnel lens makes it fairly useless. If I can't really look around properly with my eyes but only having a good picture in the middle and need to use my head for looking around, a bigger FOV wouldn't help me much. Combined with better lenses I agree with you though."
1271,"Same. Couldn't care less. I want resolution/clear images. 

I haven't tried a current gen VR headset that felt ""too heavy""."
1272,[deleted]
1273,"Form factor will be what allows a VR headset to become a work product. At that point, it will be much more valuable, than simply a consumption device. Like the difference between a tablet, and a laptop.

Friction is the most important though. Taking out your brick cell phone from your back pack, versus the one that can fit in your pocket is a big deal.

I want many things from a VR headset, and right now, the thing that keeps me from using it the most is form factor.

Sure, I am willing to put up with a brick on my face to play Beat Saber, but what about everything else? 

We will have to see if this form factor is good enough for long periods of work, or if it needs to be smaller still.

And I am saying this all in the context of the average consumers. Not us early adopters. We will put up with a lot. Shit, I had a Pimax 8kx for a bit, because of the specs only. Ergonomics were out the window."
1274,what tradeoffs? price?
1275,"100% agreed.

The VR-3‘s aspherical lenses are mindblowing and brought the biggest jump in immersion I have felt since the OG Vive."
1276,"At this point, I’d bet that ‘needing straps’ is a bigger barrier to mass market adoption than any graphical innovation."
1277,Same reason why I won't buy any headset with fresnel lenses anymore. Pancake is the minimum I'm ready to accept as of now for an upgrade.
1278,G2 has good lenses. But I'm really just hoping that Varjo make an affordable consumer version of their headset. Seems to look close to reality.
1279,"The lenses are Oculus and Valve headsets are the only ones that are clear to the edges (relatively speaking).

The reason the Quest 1 looks terrible is because of the low resolution OLED displays. Try a Quest 2, and it is night and day difference.

Blurry is the wrong way to describe it. Unless your IPD does not fit the Quest 1. Then it WOULD be blurry. Otherwise, the lenses are pretty damn sharp on the Quest 1 (relatively speaking. I have to say that because, no lens is perfect). But, the Oculus line of products, and Valve, are the only companies with lenses that are clear to the edges."
1280,[deleted]
1281,valve index is not 130 degree imo. I have both a Pimax 8kx and a Valve Index..I measure about 110 horizontal on the index with eye relief all the way in. It's an improvement over the Quest 2 but not that drastic. A headset with a weight of 200g at quest 2 fov is intriguing. I'd love it if it was 200g and 20 more degrees fov
1282,"Thats Mechwarrior online, does it even support VR in any way shape or form lol"
1283,"There is a leaked image of a Quest Pro floating around (Could easily be fake), It has a similar form factor and no top head strap.  I think the new design might allow for new types of head straps and overall ergonomics ."
1284,"You forgot the optics. Here is a size comparison between pancake vs fresnel lens module.

1285,they are two different VR Headset
1286,isn't about the same FOV of Quest 2?
1287,"there's two versions iirc, standalone and pcvr"
1288,micro OLED != microLED. Two different display technologies.
1289,"I think that it would be much better than the quest if they allow for more customization and don't hide user installed apps under a separate tab, of course then if you own a quest you could use an apk extractor app to pull apps from you quest and put them on the arpara, so having this headset might not be so bad, as long as you can get quest software using the method I said."
1290,"it will be worse. Quest 2 diagonal FOV is around 110 degrees. Marketing is always about diagonal FOV, always."
1291,"> Quest 2 is not particularly good at PCVR

Care to elaborate?"
1292,"Huh, when I have my index strapped on right I barely notice the weight. Way more comfortable than other headsets I've tried"

1294,"Putting battery and compute unit in the back is a great idea, I'm glad someone is finally doing it. Well worth the additional cost.

I don't know if I can buy a new HMD with a 95° FOV though."
1295,"It has cameras, inside out tracking like wmr/quest headsets"
1296,"Yeah, but software. Where? What? How?
Hardware checks are great, but its not the foundation for success. 

The VR graveyard is filled to capacity with companies who didnt understand that.

Until Steam become the standalone 3rd party VR app store, I dont see much changing. We all (almost) hope for that."
1297,Most steam games won't run on standalone VR
1298,"\[Citation Needed\] on ""the Quest is primarily a data gathering device"". I want to hear what ""data"" it collects on uses. And actually gathers, not some vague ""It's Facebook"", actual concrete evidence from network observation.

Oh, and preferably it should not be same data that Steam constantly collects on me."
1299,"If a standalone uses Steam/PC, it’s clearly no longer standalone. You’d need a SteamOS with ARM support and library of ARM games (or Apple-esque x86 translation)."
1300,Any standalone can use Steam… if Steam adds support for standalone and gets some standalone games. I cant see it happening before Deckard comes out.
1301,But going with bigger displays means more weight as i have an android 4k Phillips tv that's over 20 inches now todays displays aren't as heavy as an old crt display but that's still pretty heavy just imagine how much the quest 2 would weigh if it were made in the 90's or 2000's
1302,"Indeed, people don't see the big picture here. They're all arguing from the standpoint of an enthusiast or existing VR user, probably PC VR user. But the reality is that people don't think like enthusiasts, and an industry doesn't go mainstream by catering only to enthusiasts. People who don't have VR or never tried it won't even know what ""a new amazing headset with 140 degree FOV!"" means in practice. Meanwhile, they can immediately tell when a headset looks big and uncomfortable, and that will deter them from even giving VR a chance."
1303,"I think you have to differentiate. For people who don't have a Quest or another VR headset within 90-100 FOV range, this might be a reasonable option to consider.

Owners of similar FOV headsets have a right to complain though cause most of us want a significant upgrade in FOV. Preferably to a point where you don't have the goggles effect. Quest owners also would give up access to already bought games/apps.

Even if you don't mind the FOV there are lots of other factors which are big question marks at this point. Software, performance, tracking, UI, store/apps, (wireless) PCVR support,  ...

If any of the mentioned points doesn't reach a certain quality level you'd expect from a VR headset today, then it will have a hard time gaining market shares. Especially if the competion rises. Valve, Facebook, Sony, ... they all seemingly plan to release new hardware in the next 3-12 months."
1304,"This is marketing not measured, though, so it's probably diagonal. Rift S was marketed at 95. Arpara is probably similar to Rift S or worse, only years later on a ""next-gen"" device. Which is fine; they're going for small size at the expense of FOV, but personally I don't like that trade-off."
1305,"And people tend to forget how much better the sweet spot and e2e clarity gets with pancake lenses. So even if the FOV is smaller than Index or even Quest 2, you will still most likely have better immersion cause of finally being able to look around more with your eyes instead of just having a sharp image in the middle and nonstop needing to use your head."
1306,I think we should all be demanding something closer to the Varjo XR3 because why have less when this technology already exists?
1307,You can look across a Valve lens and it looks pretty good. That goes for Vive OG also. It requires optimal eye positioning.
1308,The 8K X is over 1kg with the KDMAS (its audio strap). It is way too heavy so I made the move to Reverb G2 with custom gasket.
1309,"I think movies aren’t a real use case for lost people, if they were then lots of 3doF devices would have been more popular."
1310,"I don’t think VR should be a work product for a while yet. Once something is used for work it stops being a fun joke, it’s really serious. I use VR for fun. I don’t use it because I have to. Once you have to use it there are a lot of new questions like ergonomics (not for base comfort but so you don’t get long term health or muscle issues) and a laundry list of other things."

1313,you got to try a varjo hmd? lucky b.

1315,"> Quest 2 at native res on PC is pretty much as sharp as real life tbh

Yeah, not at all actually. IIRC one of the guys from Oculus said that would be either 8K per eye or 16K per eye.

Also Quest 2 has compression artifacts visible on PC."
1316,"If you think this is true, you need to see your optometrist  to get glasses. The Quest 2 at native resolution is barely any better than the Index's resolution and is orders of magnitude behind the G2 and the Vive Pro 2. And, not even the G2 or Vive Pro 2 look like real life. You can still occasionally see pixels and can tell you're looking at a screen if you try to see it."
1317,"CV1 was supposedly 100 degrees. I had one, and Index looks like a lot more than a 10 degree improvement over that."
1318,Someone just released a VR mod for MW5!
1319,"Maybe if they're super light it'll be like wearing glasses but tied behind your head in which case I'll admit I'm wrong when people review them, but my initial impression is that I don't want to be the person who finds out."
1320,"PCVR looks real bad though, it says ""up to 6dof"" and shows a NOLO tracking module on it etc. So basically it's going to be a 3dof headset that can be hacked to be 6dof but never well tbh."
1321,"True about quest 2 diagonal, but these arpara lenses are perfect circles and not more off squarish like quest. So, it diagonal fov is same as its horizontal, as well as vertical, since the image you see is a circle. So 95° all around."

1323,"Displayport and USB 3.2 gen 2 has a max bandwidth of 10Gbps. Say you are running Link with a bitrate of 500mbps, this is still 20x slower than what is theoretically possible. Even on wired, you are getting a compressed and washed out image. For wireless, at a max bitrate of 150-200mbps (and assuming you have perfect wireless conditions) compression is very noticeable and certain scenes suffer really badly (foilage, confetti, etc). Overall wireless is a lot less immersive than Link. Quest 2 is limited by its decompression hardware, and even if you max out what its capable of for both wired/wireless, you are getting an okay but not great PCVR experience. 

In defense of Link, you can still get a really good image that is almost as clear as native. My issue with is there is a lot of friction involved with the user experience. Every time I plug in my cable, I have to put on the headset and close a ""Do you want to connect to this PC"" pop up. The Quest 2 will still drain battery when plugged in, even when not in use. So I cant leave it wired all the time or else Ill find it at 0 after several hours. So Im constantly plugging and unplugging cables from my Quest 2 wearing out the port. Speaking of the usb cable, they are very fragile, mine is a bit worn and I'm needing to replug it in multiple times to get Link to work. Switching between Link and Air Link is a pain, requiring navigating a few menus every time.

Quest 2 is an amazing jack of all trades for its price, I love mine, but will leave you wanting more if you are mainly a PCVR user. Thats why Im looking forward to the new tech to see how things get moved forward. Hopefully within the next 1 or 2 gens of VR headsets we can get better wireless implementations that can drive Link image quality."
1324,"I have the Index now for 2 years and tried everything including the magnets to change the angle of the face mask, having cut the nose area of the face mask bigger and even use that one additional top strap thingy. 

All of those helped and I can have it on for a few hours in one go, but it still simply isn't as comfortable as the OG Rift. I recently started to play Elite again and when looking upwards you can really feel all that weight on your face."
1325,"It's very well balanced, which IMO makes a much bigger difference than weight"
1326,Same. Even added the apache strap and counterweight. Still don't noticed the weight once its on and I am playing.
1327,It's a very comfortable headset but the inertia is fairly severe and often gets ignored.
1328,"You ever tried them back to back? I don't think the Index is uncomfortable in anyway, but if I put on my Rift after an hour or two with the Index the difference in weight is very noticeable."
1329,Lol. Try a G2.
1330,"I found it, hot, heavy, and noisy. But, i do recall it feeling well balanced. i just cant go back to face pressure grip head straps, after using the halo strap of the Rift S. I have the facial interface off, and nothing touches my face. The benefits are no VR face, increase fov, and it is much cooler, and comfortable."
1331,yep we need to get THIS form factor with a 130-140 degree FOV. Then VR will have arrived
1332,I wouldn't even mind the battery and compute unit being an external small box which you can just put in your pocket or strap around your arm (like joggers doing it with their smartphones). Some kind of smartphone form factor device but without the display.
1333,Oh I somehow missed that hah.  Thanks for straightening me out.
1334,"I understand the reaction, since one can feel loyalty towards a great product, but your question is akin to ""show me evidence that McDonalds profits off killing cows"". Facebook's entire business model revolves around data, just like McDonalds revolves around hamburgers. 

It's nothing hidden or secret, you've made an active decision to pay with your data to get a lower financial cost of the headset. If you want to learn about it just read about how Facebook makes almost a hundred billion a year on a free service which is expensive for them to provide, then read the privacy policy you sign for the Quest and compare it to the Steam privacy policy.

Edit:Sorry my numbers were off, Facebook's net income is 30 billion, not a hundred. Anyway, look up how that happens"

1345,"They will provide a Lighthouse module besides NOLO tracking. Only with this and the DP 1.4 cable we can really say how it will perform against other wired PCVR headsets.

P.S. OP comparing Arpara 5K weight vs Quest 2 doesn't make sense. One is Standalone, the other a tethered PCVR only headset. Take the AIO version that is specified with 380g and now it's more of a fair and logical comparison -> https://comingsoon.higizmos.com/arparaaio"
1346,"You'll see the same 95° all around, since it will be a circle. Perfect circle lenses instead of quests oblong rectangle."
1347,"Solid points, I can agree with all that. I'm quite happy with airlink for now but the second a wigig 2 wireless PCVR headset becomes available, I'm jumping on it."
1348,Dang sounds like you've explored the options haha. Could just be down to different physiology. I've got a big head so perhaps the weight is distributed better lol
1349,Index and Quest 2 plus elite strap are both plenty comfortable for me as long as I snake my hair through the top.
1350,I personally added some counterweights to the back. That way it pulls the heavy front away from my face.
1351,"Just had 2 years with Index, but always preferred Vive Pro for fit, had to use 3D printed face gasket with Vive cushion to get index tolerable, but was never comfortable.

Glad to sell it once EU warranty expired..."
1352,"That's true, the build quality on the Index is really impressive"
1353,"So, nothing. No evidence, just ""it's Facebook"".

I asked simple evidence that ""the Quest is primarily a data gathering device"", you could not even give any evidence of anything."
1354,"Ha, I knew what you mean, but that's basically ""standalone can just be non-standalone.""

Most people don't own VR-capable gaming PCs, and the GPU supply issues aren't helping."
1355,"Ah, you meant “use standalone as PCVR”. I understood it as “would be cool if all standalone VR headsets could use Steam as universal marketplace”, kinda like Google Play. Not to mention it still carries inherent PCVR problem of high entry cost."
1356,We're going to have microLED TVs so why should a microLED VR be so expensive? BTW I think microLED and OLED are different things.
1357,I thought it was $8000. That's actually good news for me! lmfao.
1358,Damn dude 💸
1359,[removed]
1360,"Certainly, I do believe it was there people that it's super comfortable (and arguably it's not too bad for me)."
1361,Tried that (were part of the top strap bundle) but that felt more uncomfortable to me because of the added total weight.
1362,"What do you mean no evidence? Is telling you to read the recipe for a Big Mac not evidence that Big Mac has meat in it? 

They are stating in plain text that they gather information on your physical attributes (like how tall you are and how big your hands are) and how you move, while stating that they are not *currently* using this specific data in products for sales to third parties, but how you play games, what you do in the browser, your interactions with other players etc. etc. is all gathered and integrated into their products which they sell to advertisers. This is what they are stating, are you saying Facebook is lying about using your data for ads?

It's all data, and data is how Facebook makes money. You even have settings in the Quest app to customize this yourself, and you still don't believe it? You think they just need your permission for all this, but then out of moral niceness just say ""no we don't want to make money from what you legally agreed to let us do, we just want you to have a nice fun time"".

I don't think you thought this through. I understand the privacy policy can be wordy and vague, but at least look at Facebook's business model and profits before speculating further."
1363,"Pleasure to use. And once 3k per eye and clear lenses are mainstream, it‘ll be a whole different level of immersion."
1364,Yes but our natural fiekd of vision is far above 95 degrees so that doesn't play into affect. Would still see only 95 degrees all around with the headset
1365,Not on top. Has to go all the way to the back (preferable below the tightening screw behind). On top of you head it won't really do much. Also you might want to widen (or make more comfortable) the strap that goes across the top of your head.
1366,"Let me quote again:

>the Quest is primarily a data gathering device

Evidence, now.

Your claim is ""McDonalds uses beef in their burgers, therefore their ice cream is also made from beef"".

You also ignore that right after telling what data they collect, they also state that the data is not stored anywhere. It's simply used for *basic operation.* Index collects that *exact same information* because it needs that information to properly function. It is not stored anywhere."

No no, you misunderstood me. I bought an additional strap for on top (that really helped a fair bit) and in that bundle was also a counterweight for the back. I use the top strap but the counterweight was doing more harm than good.

1369,"Dude, I told you to read the evidence. You're just making a fool of yourself now because you clearly haven't read it. 

And you haven't answered my questions. In the privacy policy Facebook says that it gathers multiple points of data from your VR usage, integrates it with your behaviour online and on other Facebook products, and uses it for their business. Are you saying Facebook is lying, or are you just making up some random fantasy in your head and completely ignoring the plain text information provided to you?

Edit: to be clear, it's only a very limited amount of data that is locally stored on the headset, and even with that they're saying it's not *currently* going to be used for marketing."
1370,"I'm not understanding you. Fov is fov. Has nothing to do with moving your head. Its the angle of vision from you pupil at center to the farthest line of sight on the edges. If you mean its more comfortable with a more rectangular fov, that's fine for your preference. Not more 'efficient'"
1371,"And I tell you, actually present it. Saying ""Evidence totally is there"" is not evidence. That's conspiracy thinking. If Quest 2 was, and I quote again:

>the Quest is primarily a data gathering device

You would actually be able to show this. Instead, all you do is say ""It's Facebook!""

I can make such accusations too. Index collects all your information, from your height, to eye distance, to hand size, to what brands are visible in your room. My evidence? Go read their TOS. It's all there.

All you have is conspiracy theory thinking of ""It must be there, because I think it is there, and just because they are not doing anything right now, must mean they *will* do eventually!""

All you have to do is to present evidence that Quest 2 transmits the information to Facebook. It should be simple task, right? Or maybe it isn't, because you can't prove anything. All you have is feel-good conspiracies of ""I am so smart for not falling for the trap!""."
1372,"I'm sorry, you seem to have issues with reading comprehension. I'll write it out in caps for you:

THE EVIDENCE IS THAT FACEBOOK IS CLEARLY AND OPENLY STATING, IN THE DOCUMENT YOU SIGN, THAT THEY ARE GATHERING YOUR DATA IN VR, INCLUDING ALL ACTIVITY IN GAMES, AND INTEGRATING IT WITH YOUR OTHER BEHAVIOUR ONLINE AND ON FACEBOOK IN ORDER TO ASSIST THEIR MARKETING AND ADVIRTISEMENT. 

Is this understandable to you? Is it getting through now that it's in caps? Because I'm literally running out of way to explain this to you. You refuse to read the actual text, but now you have it all in caps please don't ask again."
1373,"Except they are not. I dare you to actually quote where they say ""We gather *and store* your information"".

Again, I challenged you actually present evidence. All you have done is throw accusations around and claim ""it totally is there"". Let me show you how this is done:

Steam collects your information and shares it with third parties. Quoting [Steam Privacy Agreement](https://store.steampowered.com/privacy_agreement/) (funny how there is none for Index... how can we trust them?)

1. Definitions

>Wherever we talk about Personal Data below, we mean any information that can either itself identify you as an individual (""Personally Identifying Information"") or that can be connected to you indirectly by linking it to Personally Identifying Information.

Such anonymous data does not allow the identification of the customers to which it relates. **Valve may share anonymous data, aggregated or not, with third parties.**

This is how you actually present evidence. Not just ""evidence totes is out there, do my work for me"". Now go ahead and show where Quest 2 collects and stores information that Index doesn't.

Because again: you claimed that Quest is ""primarily a data gathering device"". Not a VR device, not a gaming device, *a data gathering device.* Now start presenting evidence or admit you are just conspiracy theorist."
1374,"What the hell is this? You link me a privacy policy with the ""anonymous"" part even boldened. Anonymous is a word that means that the data is not tied to you as a person. Also if you read further you'll see that steam isn't a company built on creating advertising products based on who you are as a human, and therefor they are clear that they do not create ad products from your data. Facebook is very clear about the fact that they do.

>Except they are not.

Please expand. Why are you saying Facebook is lying about this. What more is it you need in order to understand their policy regarding Oculus? I have told you Facebook's position on this, and you believe they are lying, why?"
1375,">What the hell is this? You link me a privacy policy with the ""anonymous"" part even boldened.

So? Valve still collects that information and shares it. System is no different from Facebooks ad service. Facebooks knows *exactly* what *you* do and shares it, just doesn't tell others it's *you* specifically. Just. Like. Facebook.

>Also if you read further you'll see that steam isn't a company built on creating advertising products based on who you are as a human,

Game recommendations say hi. Steam is exactly build around advertising games to you that you might buy, this generating revenue.

> Facebook is very clear about the fact that they do.

And I still ask you to actually prove that, let me quote *once again*: ""the Quest is primarily a data gathering device"".

>Please expand. Why are you saying Facebook is lying about this. 

Collecting data and storing it are two different things. Your height, hand size, room size etc. are collected, sure, but they are *not stored* because that data is only used to run the device. Index, G2 and every other headset collects this data too, because it's a requirement for their function.

Case in point, (https://support.oculus.com/articles/accounts/privacy-information-and-settings/hand-tracking-privacy-notice)[see Hand Tracking Privacy Notice] for following statement:

>What Data Is Collected
>
>We do not collect images or estimated points of your hands on our servers. As stated above, this data is processed on the device and deleted once processing is completed.

So, do you yet understand why I demand evidence, or are you still going to just go ""Facebook bad!"" instead of the actual evidence?

Because if so, I expect you to start crusade against Valve too, as they effectively forced Steam  on people just so they can spy on what games we play, how much we play and when we play, all to better sell us games."
1376,"Thanks, now I see where your misunderstanding stems from. It seems maybe you read my comments a little too quickly, as I explicitly stated that the data on your physical measurements is stored locally and, as Facebook puts it, not *currently* gathered. 

Please re-read my previous comments first if you have any other questions about what data they do gather and what they do with it. Also, read the rest of the Steam policy to understand better how they use the data in a very different way from Facebook.

>Please re-read my previous comments first if you have any other questions about what data they do gather and what they do with it. Also, read the rest of the Steam policy to understand better how they use the data in a very different way from Facebook.

There is no difference. Your data is anonymized by Facebook for the exact same reason why Steam does so: it's valuable to them. It seems to me it is *you* who do not understand how Facebook the social site works and thus you turn to baseless accusations against the headset.

>And I thought I wouldn't have to do this since it would be so quick for you to just Google it if you cared about facts, but clearly you just want to argue a made up hypothesis so here you go, please read this before going any further with your own personal fantasy which directly contradicts Facebook's official position https://www.oculus.com/legal/privacy-policy/

Can you actually cite specific parts where Quest 2 collects some nebulous ""data"" that is not collected by Index and Valve? You seem to love your accusations, but you seem to be utterly resistant to actually presenting any actual *evidence*."
1378,"I actually made a pre-emptive edit to my previous comment as I suspected you would have difficulty reading the document. But here it is again. If you want more, I'm not going to come over and narrate the entire document for you, you will have to read for yourself.

Also, I never said it was ""nebulous"". It's their clear and open business practice. You are the one talking about ""conspiracies"" and stuff. This is what Facebook is as a company. Just as McDonalds sells hamburgers, Facebook sells ad products to companies created from who you are as a person and how you interact with your friends and family. 

Again. Please just read the documents now. You're being silly with insisting that you know better than Facebook about how they use the data from the Quest. And also comparing Facebook to Steam is ridiculous. I've literally provided you with links and quotes you could've easily googled yourself if you were interested. But you're not, you've just got a weird idea stuck in your head that you want to argue, and don't give a damn about facts or the official position of Facebook, so I'm out. 

You're gonna want to continue with not reading or understanding how the Oculus data is used, and say ""you haven't provided any evidence because you didn't get Mark Zuckerberg to come home to me and read the document out loud"", but for anyone else interested, all the evidence is right there clearly stated in their official policy."
1379,"AKA they share exact same data that Valve does. And you still haven't shown the ""Quest is primarly data gathering device"" paet, almost as if you are intentionally ignoring it.

You can't show difference, all you can do is say ""Facebook bad, stop questioning me"""
1380,"Hahaha you're hopeless. I have made my case very clearly, over and over, based on Facebook's own statements, official policies, and how they officially operate as a business. 

Your decision not to want to read and understand this, or to make believe it is in any way similar to the gaming conpany Valve, is up to you and there's nothing I can do about your personal decision not to learn facts. Just let it sink in a while, you're clearly stuck and unable to process new information right now. Let it settle a while."
1381,"There is difference how FREE social site works and how their VR ecosystem works. Your incapability to understand the difference leads you to believe they are the exact same.

I would not be shocked if you believed that McDonalds makes its money via hamburger sales. Or that Valves money comes from selling their games. 

Because you seem to only understand most simple business models, and ca't comprehend that there might be more than one.

You still fail to provide actual evidence, only citing ""they are Facebook"" followed by ""they will do something""."
1382,"I cited Facebook's official explanation of what data they gather through the Quest, how they use it, and how it's a part of Facebook's business as an ad product company. Over and over. And you're not gonna be taking in that information, so get lost, you don't need to clarify any further that you refuse to read and learn this right now."
1383,"And nowhere in that ""explanation"" you cited did they say that Quest is ""primarily data gather device"", nor is any data they collect any different from Steam.

So either you are hypocrite, you are still trying to present Facebook as somehow ""different"". Your height, handsize, etc are not used for advertising.

I understand that is complicated to understand that company can have more than one business model, but when it comes to VR they don't make money via ads. They make money same way Valve does, and collect exact same information as Valve.

The fact that you can't comprehend it and instead cherry pick lines, ignoring everything around then, shows how you are too stuck in your ""Facebook bad"" view. You can't comprehend that company might operate different ways, so you think one model applies to everything.

Again: their privacy agreement is no different from Steams. I challenge you to find the actual *difference*. And I mean actual, not ""they say anonymous here, and in here non-identifying"". Those are same thing."
1384,">Your height, handsize, etc are not used for advertising.

I know, I explained that part to you.

>but when it comes to VR they don't make money via ads

I literally quoted you the part where Facebook clarifies that they do make money via ads targeted through data they gather from VR.

Valve is a gaming company and Steam is a gaming platform.

> ""Facebook bad"" 

I've never said Facebook is bad, I was just trying to explain how they make money to a brick wall, including how they integrate VR into that business model. You're the one going off about ""conspiracies"", them being ""nebulous"" and now ""Facebook bad"". I'm not judging, just explaining.

> their privacy agreement is no different from Steams. I challenge you to find the actual difference.

Steam anonymises data and does in no way use it to create personalized ad products for political parties, societal institutions, and any company that pays them. Facebook owns all the data of who you are as a person, and how you interact with your family and friends, ties all the data to you as a person, and uses that data to build products which they sell to ad companies. Their VR platform is fully integrated into this and is in no way separate from it, as they clearly explain when saying that they will use the data they gather from your game playing to integrate it with your behaviour across all other Facebook products and other websites, to make better ads.

Look, how many times am I gonna have to repeat myself here? Just give up, you've got nothing except saying the same thing over and over regardless of the mountains of evidence against your idea. I am refuting your same points over and over with official documentation from Facebook itself. You got stuck because you didn't know fully why Facebook, an ad product company, is investing so heavily into VR. Just accept facts and wait for clarity to move in. Just re-read stuff now if you have more questions."
1385,"No. They do not say ""we make money via ads"". That is your simplified reading. What they do saybis that data collected *may* be used to show personalized content, including ads. Which are *game recomendations*. Ypu know, exact same thing that Steam does.

Aand once again you fail to understand that compamies do have other ways to generate money than one. Line said, you are person who thinks McDonalds makes money with *hamburgers*, because those are most obvious to you."
1386,"Dude, why are you doing this to yourself?

>How do we use this information?"", including to provide, personalise and improve the Facebook Products (including seamless integration between the Facebook Products); to provide measurement, analytics and other business services (including ads); to promote safety, integrity and security; to communicate with you; and to research and innovate for social good

From that you extrapolate ""they just wanna tell me about cool games!"".

And what I said about McDonalds is that they use cows to make hamburgers, just like Facebook uses data to make ad products. Because I was trying to make it easy for you to understand, but I guess that backfired.

Anyway, since you're not going to read anything from Facebook, just read that qoute above over and over if you think about making stuff up again."
1387,">From that you extrapolate ""they just wanna tell me about cool games!"".

Yes. Because[Steams Privacy Policy](https://store.steampowered.com/privacy_agreement/) contains exact same line:

>2. Why Valve Collects and Processes Data  
>  
>Valve collects and processes Personal Data for the following reasons:  
>  
>a) where it is necessary for the performance of our agreement with you to provide a full-featured gaming service and **deliver associated Content and Services;**  
>  
>b) where it is necessary for compliance with legal obligations that we are subject to (e.g. our obligations to keep certain information under tax laws);  
>  
>c) where it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate and legal interests of Valve or a third party (e.g. the interests of our other customers), except where such interests are overridden by your prevailing legitimate interests and rights; or  
>  
>d) where you have given consent to it.  
>  
>These reasons for collecting and processing Personal Data determine and limit what Personal Data we collect and how we use it (section 3. below), how long we store it (section 4. below), who has access to it (section 5. below) and what rights and other control mechanisms are available to you as a user (section 6. below).

Notice ""associated content and services"". Guess what Facebook calls these?  Facebook Products.

Now, you might to this line:

>to provide measurement, analytics and other business services (including ads)

But as I stated, Steam has same line:

>3.7 Content Recommendations  
>  
>We may process information collected under this section 3 so that content, products and services shown on the pages of the Steam store and in update messages displayed when launching the Steam Client can be tailored to meet your needs and populated with relevant recommendations and offers. This is done to improve your customer experience. You can prevent the processing of your data in this way by turning off the automatic loading of the Steam store page and of Steam notifications in the ""Interface"" section of the Steam Client settings.  
>  
>**Subject to your separate consent or where explicitly permitted under applicable laws on email marketing, Valve may send you marketing messages about products and services offered by Valve to your email address.** **In such a case we may also use your collected information to customize such marketing messages as well as collect information on whether you opened such messages and which links in their text you followed.**  
>  
>You can opt out or withdraw your consent to receive marketing emails at any time by either withdrawing the consent on the same page where you previously provided it or clicking the ""unsubscribe"" link provided in every marketing email.

Indeed, unlike Facebook, Valve sends their ads (I am sorry, ""marketing messages"") directly to your email.

So yes, if Valve's statement is ""just selling games"", then so is Facebooks. Otherwise, you are just being a hypocrite who refuses to acknowledge that said TOS is as cookiecutter as possible. That, or you are incapable of understanding that companies have more than one way to make money.

>And what I said about McDonalds is that they use cows to make hamburgers, just like Facebook uses data to make ad products. Because I was trying to make it easy for you to understand, but I guess that backfired.

And like I said, because you see McDonalds use cows to make hamburgers, you think *that is only thing they do* and only way they make money. Hint: real money is in *soft drinks,* not in burgers. That is on products they sell directly. What McDonalds *truly* makes they money is on land leasing business. Every single McDonalds restaurants *land* is owned by McDonalds corporation and those running the place *pay rent to run the shop.* That generates far more revenue than burgers, frieds and sodas *ever* could.

But you would ignore that, and insist that only thing on McDonalds menu is beef burgers, because that is only thing you understand.

In similar style, Valve makes video games, but that is not how they make *money*: their real moneymaker is in *microtransactions.* Just look at the Team Fortress 2, thje premier war-themed hat simular. Or Dota 2 with its billion skins or Counter-Strike. Half-Life Alyx? That is not a money maker for Valve. It's microtransactions and sales on Steam, for which they have been sued for monopolistic actions several times, latest being Humble Bundle founders lawsuit."
1388,"> products and services offered by Valve

That's games, only through Valve, where you can:

>You can opt out or withdraw your consent to receive marketing emails at any time

That is in no shape or form similar to anything related to Facebooks business model of collecting full information on your entire personality, everyone you know and your interactions with them, every place you visit and every game you play and how you play those games. Just to name a few of the things they gather to then...

Create ad products to sell to the highest bidder, including political parties, social institutions, schools, the army, healthcare providers etc. etc. 

I'm sorry that my example of hamburgers made from cows confused you so terribly, I was just trying to make you understand but you flew away into a completely different subject with it. 

So again, Valve is a gaming company, and Facebook is an ad company. They are two completely different companies. Every single company you interact with gathers data from you, the question is how much data and what do they do with it. I have explained to you how it works with facebook, and you're going crazy about it trying to bring McDonald's and Valve's business-models into some sort of comparison with Facebook. You might as well try to say Facebook does the same thing as SpaceX, because they also process data. It's ridiculous and you're only being emotional because you found out you were wrong. 

So, do you need me to quote again how your data on Oculus is fully incorporated into the entire Facebook business-model? Or are you going to thank me now for this repeated explanation of how Oculus is a data-gathering device which has the potential of putting Facebook way ahead of the competition in its field? I'm not even saying it's bad, data is very valuable and it's a smart move by facebook to do this."
1389,"No, Valve also offers hardware (Steam controller, Steam machine, Index, Steamdeck) and social services (forums, friends, etc.). In fact *games* are one of the things they *don't*, as games are offered by third parties through Steam.

Facebook is not am ad company. It is multiservice company, ads are *one* part of it, not the only thing. Just like Valve games are only one part of Valves services.

Again, you fail to understand that just because hamburgers are made of beef does not mean their chicken sandwhich is also made out of beef. Or that McDonals business model is more complex than ""sell beef hamburgers"".

You need to find the quote where they say that Quest 2 sends all data it collects to adservices. That is your claim, claim you consistently fail to back. Quest 2 collects no more that Index does."
1390,">Facebook is not am ad company. It is multiservice company, ads are one part of it, not the only thing

Yeah, ads are only 98% of Facebook's $86 billion dollar revenue, they hardly even matter! Facebook is explicitly an ad company buddy and data is the resource they use to sell ads. 

This conversation is almost funny now in how you keep stating made up crazy ideas which you could've easily cured with just 30 seconds of Googling on the things I recommended you look up in the first place. https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/120114/how-does-facebook-fb-make-money.asp

And please drop your completely unrelated jammering about McDonalds. 

>You need to find the quote where they say that Quest 2 sends all data it collects to adservices.

I literally showed you the qoute, multiple times, although I have no idea where you got ""all"" from, since I also explained to you there is some data which is only stored locally and which Facebook states is not currently used by them. 

You're really not getting anywhere here man. I'm literally just stating facts as they are explained by Facebook themselves, and you're trying to bring McDonalds and Valve into it which are completely and utterly different companies from Facebook."
1391,"You are the one who came up with McDonalds first, and it perfectly shows your ignorance. You see one obvious way for company to make money, and therefore won't even consider other business models.

RealityLabs is relatively.new division with Facebook, but it's money generation method is entirely different from the rest of the company, which is why it is listed as ""other"". 

You have not shown anything. All you have done is cherry pick line, go ""Ads!"" and then pretended that there are no other revenue streams for Facebook. You then pretended that Steam Privacy Pplicy does not contain exact same provisions and insist there is some.mgaical difference without being capable of actually explaining what said difference is.

Remember, this started with you claiming that Quest was ""primarly data gathering device"", statement you have not yet backed in anyway."
1392,"I'm the ignorant one for saying hamburgers are made from cows? What do you think they're made of, fairy dust? I don't give a shit about McDonalds business model to you keep harping on about, hamburgers are made from cows.

Facebook makes 98% of its $86 billion revenue from ads. It's an ad company. With tiny tiny parts that are separate from ad income that are there to boost the ad income over time. You clearly didn't know Facebook was an ad company, you didn't look it up after I told you so you embarrassed yourself and now even after I told you, you keep going trying to pretend you didn't hear. It's an ad company, and everything single thing they do is related to gathering data to make more money and compete with the other ad companies.

Steam does absolutely not contain any line whatsoever explaining how it's going to use your data from games to integrate with your personality profile in order to create ad products to sell to the highest bidder because Steam does not do that or anything similar to that. That was a stupid suggestion from the very beginning and you know it's untrue and a pathetically desperate interpretation on your part. Drop that idiocy, Valve isn't an ad company keeping a highly developed personality profile tied to you and the status of your relationship with your friends and family, don't just make shit up. What games you play isn't your personality.

With that moronic argument you could easily say Netflix is the same as Facebook, because they also gather data. Ubisoft is the same as Facebook? Spotify is the same as Facebook? Stop and think for a second. 

Facebook makes $86 billion dollars a year almost EXCLUSIVELY from your data. You're welcome for the info which I told you to look up right at the beginning."
1393,"You are ignorant because you do not understand that different products work different way. Just because hamburgers are made out of cows, does not mean that the chicken sandwhich is also made out of cow.

You are arguing that because *free* services by Facebook are funded via ads, their *sold* products are also showing ads and used to show ads. This is demonstrably false, as anyone who has actually used the headset can instantly tell you.

These are ads. Just because they are not ads for other sites does not magically make them ""not ads"". You are doing nothing but moving the goalpost, something you have through all this discussion. You are trying to redefine words in order to claim that your initial, false statement was somehow ""correct"" under these new definitions.

Again: What Facebook does to generate money via VR headsets and their free services are *two different things*. Reason why their privacy policy says ""including ads"" is because they call recomendations ads, which they are. Beyond content recomendations, something that Steam does too, the headset contains no ads at all.

As such, trying to pretend that the headset is ""primarly data gather device"" is flat out lie, as that statement explicitly claims that the headsets functinality as a VR device is *secondary*."
1394,">You are ignorant because you do not understand that different products work different way. Just because hamburgers are made out of cows, does not mean that the chicken sandwhich is also made out of cow.

Unless they clearly state ""this chicken sandwich is made out of cow"", in which case it's probably a good idea to listen and not make up your own private  fantasy about it

>You are arguing that because free services by Facebook are funded via ads, their sold products are also showing ads and used to show ads. This is demonstrably false, as anyone who has actually used the headset can instantly tell you

Nowhere have I argued this, stop making more shit up all of a sudden. You're so lost in fantasy land you haven't even read what I'm trying to explain to you. Did you really think this was what I was saying?  How? I'm saying the data they gather from your VR use is fully integrated into their profiling and business model. Facebook is also saying this. In fact the only one not saying that is you.

>Again: What Facebook does to generate money via VR headsets and their free services are two different things.

Yeah I know that's your magical fantasy. Even when I show you Facebook writing out that all the data they gather in VR is fully integrated into their profiling of you across all their products and more, you still like to live in your magical fairy tale. But it's still WRONG, and you have been clearly disproven on that point by Facebook themselves.

So every company that sends ads is the same as Facebook to you. Really? You're really trying to convince me of that? So you're sure Netflix and Spotify operate just the same as Facebook? That's what you're telling me? This is so retarded."
1395,">Unless they clearly state ""this chicken sandwich is made out of cow"", in which case it's probably a good idea to listen and not make up your own private  fantasy about it

So, tell me where in Oculus Privacy Policy it says ""Quest is primarly data gathering device"". You still haven't shown this. All you have done is cherry pick a *word* from larger policy text and then pretend that is all there is.

>Nowhere have I argued this, stop making more shit up all of a sudden. You're so lost in fantasy land you haven't even read what I'm trying to explain to you. Did you really think this was what I was saying? How? I'm saying the data they gather from your VR use is fully integrated into their profiling and business model. Facebook is also saying this. In fact the only one not saying that is you.

You stated that Quest is ""primarly data gathering device"". You then proceeded to present ""Facebook has ad service"" as an evidence. It's pretty dishonest for you to claim you never argued otherwise. Hell, even now you insist that business of Quest is to collect data for ads!

>Yeah I know that's your magical fantasy. 

There is no other fantasy here except your ""company can only have one *singular* way of doing thing and everything, absolutely everything, is done to that way"".

Again, this is like you claiming that only way McDonalds makes money is via selling hamburgers made out of cow. They do sell those, but they are not their only way of making money.

>So every company that sends ads is the same as Facebook to you. 

Fundamentally, yes. I don't pretend that just because Valve sends me ""recomendations"" that they are not ads. I don't pretend that companies are my friends. I don't apply double standards of ""it's only ad if it is done by ad company"". Both are ads, both are marketing.

I don't need to be a hypocrite to realize that Valve is trying to get me to buy shit from them.

You think that Facebook selling adspaces for others to try to sell you products is magically different from Valve doing it themselves, so you buy products direcdtly from them.

You then proceed to act as if Facebook producing a VR device was made to show ads and ""collect data"", instead of *being a VR device*. You treat Quest 2 as primary spy device and VR device as secondary, when it collects no more than Steam collects of you. You can't even show actual difference in the data collected, all you can do is say ""BUT FACEBOOK!"""
1396,">So, tell me where in Oculus Privacy Policy it says ""Quest is primarly data gathering device"".

98% of Facebook's revenue is ad-related from data gathered. Data gathered from Oculus use is fully integrated into this system. You have no questions whatsoever as to why a data driven ad company choose to buy a VR-gaming company and sell hardware at a very low price, and that's fine, but you also refuse to read the answers they give themselves. 

>All you have done is cherry pick a word from larger policy text and then pretend that is all there is.

A word? Actually it's several words. And the words happen to be ""all the data we gather from your Oculus use is integrated with all other Facebook products and used for research, selling ads and ""social good"""" And I ""cherry picked"" that sentence since that is the sentence that clearly and irrefutably proved you are completely wrong about the data only being used for VR and that Facebook VR is somehow separate from the rest of Facebook.

>Hell, even now you insist that business of Quest is to collect data for ads!

Of course it is, just as Messenger and Instagram do. Because data is 98% of their revenue and their entire business model revolves around it. There is nothing on Facebook separate from gathering data for ad products. Why are you still stuck thinking that Oculus is on some magical private island paradise separated from the rest of Facebook and they're just saying no to unique and highly valuable data which they have your permission to gather and use? Even after they explicitly tell you that they are gathering data for ads from your Oculus use?

>Fundamentally, yes. I don't pretend that just because Valve sends me ""recomendations"" that they are not ads. 

With that definition every company on earth is the same. So that's just silly. And Facebook aren't sending you ads. Facebook is creating ad plattforms from your data so that other companies show you targeted ads.

>I don't need to be a hypocrite to realize that Valve is trying to get me to buy shit from them.

You're not ""buying shit"" from Facebook. Ad agencies buy shit from Facebook. 

>Again, this is like you claiming that only way McDonalds makes money is via selling hamburgers made out of cow. They do sell those, but they are not their only way of making money.

If 98% of McDonalds revenue was from hamburgers, that would be practically the only way they make money. Trying to argue against that is so futile I don't understand why you're even trying.

>You think that Facebook selling adspaces for others to try to sell you products is magically different from Valve doing it themselves.

I don't ""think"" that, I am stating clearly and factually those are two fundamentally different things. Every company shows ads, every media company has recommendation algorithms. Facebook builds an extensive and detailed profile on you and all your friends and family, and your relationship with them, in order to create platforms for companies to buy ads on. That is completely different and you know it, no reason to be obstinate about such an obvious thing.

>You then proceed to act as if Facebook producing a VR device was made to show ads and ""collect data"",

Yes, Facebook is an ad company. They didn't pay huge amounts of money to buy the primary VR company just because they love to see you having fun, or are desperate for a tiny tiny revenue stream of games. And I haven't even mentioned ads being shown in the Oculus app, that is a tiny market and not of big interest at all, the ads are shown in your browser. Incidentally though, Facebook are also opening up more possibilities to show ads on Oculus too

https://www.oculus.com/blog/testing-in-headset-vr-ads/

But again that's insignificant compared to the value of your data for regular ads.

> You can't even show actual difference in the data collected, all you can do is say ""BUT FACEBOOK!""

Why are you still stuck on what data is collected? I've already explained to you very clearly how their methods of collecting data are vastly different and serve completely different purposes. And  I've already explained to you that what matters is how the data is stored and used, which I've also shown you is vastly different between Facebook and Valve. Many many times. 

Is this ever going to sink in? Your still stuck on ""BUT FACEBOOK"" even after I clearly and in detail explained to you how they work and create revenue, and I haven't even said if I think it's bad or good. You have some kind of idea in your head that I'm critizing Facebook and you're defending it. Drop that idea, that's not what's happening. I'm explaining how Facebook makes money, specifically how they use Oculus to make money, and you're refusing to listen because you feel like I'm attacking Facebook by explaining how they create revenue. You didn't even know they were explicitly an ad company and you still keep going..."
1397,"And again, you can't actually show anything. All you can do is say ""Facebook is ad company!""

It's pretty clear all you got is conspiracy theories. Not actual evidence. You can't show actual concrete evidence, all you can say is ""Facebook!"" You can't even show the supposed data that is collected (that would be in anyway be different from every other headset)"
1398,"I literally just disproved every point there in the comment you're replying to. So you're not even reading my comments at all anymore. I'm just gonna go ahead and reply to you with the Facebook policy from now on.

Reminder: Facebook is solely a data based ad company. 98%of $86 billion."
1403,"Ah yes, ""solely data based ad company"". That is why they have *every other revenue source*. Like selling headsets and apps. Clearly these are just ""ads"". I didn't buy a headset, I bought an ad!

Like I said. You are person who thinks only source of revenue of McDonalds are hamburgers, because you can not grasp complicated concept of ""Company can generate revenue more than one way""."
1404,"Aw, you already forgot that 98% of their 86 billion dollar revenue is ads, and that they make next to zero or possibly even take a loss on their VR-headsets? Well, here's your reminder."
1405,"Ah yes, because field they just entered should totally dwarf the field they started in.

Furthermore, the fact that VR is growing part of their revenue is evidence that your claim them being ""solely ad company"" is bunk.

Or do you not understand meaning of the words you use?"
1406,"Yes, VR increases their ad revenue and gives them huge potential to get ahead of the competition in that area with more unique and accurate data. And the competition is in no way Valve. It's Google (mainly YouTube), Apple, Tiktok, Snapchat and other major players. You think Facebook is spending billions on VR just because they think it's fun and exciting, which is cute, but also retarded. 

Hey, it seems at least you've at last understood that the data they gather in VR is in no way separate from their other data on you. Progress!"
1407,"There is no ""accurate data"" they can get from the headset that actually helps them to sell adspace. You are doing nothing but revealing how *little* you know about how Facebooks ad system operates.

No, Facebook is not putting money into VR because it's ""fun and exciting"", but they are also not spending billions of dollars to sell headsets at price that they will never recover via ads. Their goal is to become dominant force in the emerging market, since they missed the smartphone emergence and now have to bow to Google and Apple.

Let me ask you, do you also think that your phone is ""primarly data gathering device"" too, since Googles primary revenue source is ads?

Money Facebook gets from ads per single user is roughly 15 dollars per year. In contrast, VR users spend 50 to 100 dollars a year. 

Your incapability to understand concept of ""diversification"" and that companies can have more than one revenue stream shows how narrow minded you are. 

Tell me, if Quest 2 is ""primarly data gathering device"" (AKA *spy device*), where is all the network activity where they send all this data? There isn't. Only thing you have is *one instance* of them mentioning word ""ads"" in the policy and you are so fixated on that you miss the forest for the trees.

But fine, I let you ""go"", you can take your ""NO! IT MUST BE ADS! I CAN NOT COMPREHEND MORE COMPLEX THOUGHTS!"" idea and wallow in it."
1408,">There is no ""accurate data"" they can get from the headset that actually helps them to sell adspace. 

When you play games, how you play games, your proficiency in games, who you play games with, what type of games you prefer, for how long you play certain games, how likely you are to give up on a challenge, when you stop playing games, who you play games with, who's in your home when you play games, anything that can be measured with an achievement etc. etc. there is TONS of unique data.

>Let me ask you, do you also think that your phone is ""primarly data gathering device""

Regarding Facebook and Google? Are you fucking joking? You don't even think Facebook sees your phone as primarily a data gathering device!? Holy shit of course it is, they are facing serious problems now that Apple wants to keep iPhone data for itself. Oh my god you are really clueless.

>Money Facebook gets from ads per single user is roughly 15 dollars per year. In contrast, VR users spend 50 to 100 dollars a year. 

Hahaha that is one of the most desperate manipulations of data I've probably ever seen. Holy shit that was funny. Didn't you feel disgusted by yourself by trying to average Facebook's income from all it's inactive users a few years ago and then compare to *spending* of the average VR user today? Hahaha Jesus you're so desperate. First of all, your first desperate stat actually **MORE THAN TEN TIMES HIGHER THAN WHAT YOU STATED** for north America https://www.statista.com/statistics/251328/facebooks-average-revenue-per-user-by-region/ 
**AROUND $165 PER USER FOR LAST YEAR.**

Then you compare it to ""spending"", which is ridiculous. So anyway, you got caught in your disgustingly retarded li'l lie. What have you got to say for yourself, and how did you feel when you had to desperately resort to lying when trying to defend your position? Dont you feel dirty for trying to pull that stunt?

>Only thing you have is one instance of them mentioning word ""ads"" in the policy

Why the fuck would they mention it twice? It's perfectly clear as it is. And it's in the context of how they gather your data and integrate with your other usage in order to make more than $165 out of you per year.

>Your incapability to understand concept of ""diversification""

Yeah sure, that's cute. ""We're in a desperate competition for data, and it's our entire business model, but do you know what would be fun? Risking a huge loss in a completely separate area unrelated to what we do! If we succeed and beat the competitors there we can make way way less money than what we're making in our current market!""... this fantasy of yours is clearly disproven already.

Anyway. Now I know your a liar who's prepared to make up desperate and crazy lies to try to back up your fantasy. So, no use to continue since you'll just make up anything and don't give a shit about facts. Byeee."

For about 2 days I was thinking it was too small, and then all of the sudden it felt so right… it even started to feel like a normal “large” phone. And now anytime I get a normal iPhone in my hands I am borderline disgusted by how big it is. They are far too much for me and I have no interest in ever going back to that size."
1416,"I use a 13 mini as a secondary line. I love the form factor too. The only downside is if you are a power user, the battery may not last a day.

Other than that, it serves me well."
1417,All three of my kids have the 12 Mini and every time I help them troubleshoot something I’m reminded of how freeing a small phone can be.
1418,"I loved my 12 mini but the battery life drove me nuts. Just got a 14 Pro, and while I love some of the features, I’m disappointed they didn’t make a 14 mini"
1419,"I moved from Android to IPhone specifically for the 12 mini. I was tired of big phones that popped out of my pocket, or felt uncomfortable if I bent over. The Zenphone 9 wasn’t out in Canada at the time so after some searching around I wandered into an Apple Store for the first time and tried out the mini. I miss a lot about Android, but this form factor is great for an everyday phone. 

It’s important to note that aside from some emails/Reddit and messaging, I don’t use my phone for gaming or serious work. It’s a good for photos, but when we go out someplace I still pack the DSLR.

Edit:more info."
1420,"I love the size of my Mini 12, hate the battery life and it has other issues if overheating and screen dimming, but I can’t give it up because the size is so perfect. My wife has a 14 pro max and it is just impossible to hold comfortably. The perfect combo is iPad mini + iPhone mini"
1421,"It’s the best phone in the world no arguments.

I feel like I can scientifically prove it too - I have regular sized hands and I cannot reach the top left of the screen to pull down the Notification Centre without readjusting my grip.

Therefore anything bigger than that is a waste except for media viewing.

All imo.

Oh and it fits in the band BEAUTIFULLY. And the pocket - you hardly know it’s there unlike some android monstrosities that are pulling your jeans down to your ankles."
1422,"Love my 13 mini. Absolutely perfect size — to be honest, now that’s I’m used to it I could go even smaller, something the reduced bezels of the upcoming generation would allow for. If only the kept this screen size!!!"
1423,"Form factor is godly good. It's just text on the phone is harder to read. Typing with smaller keys and just overall media consumption won't give you that wow factor. But size is amazing. 

Great phone for activities or just on the go and need to carry light"
1424,Love the mini form factor. Had the 12 mini and upgraded to the 13 mini in December. Hope Apple bring backs the mini for future models. Even with aging eyes I still prefer the smaller form factor.
1425,"I downgraded from the 14PM to the 13 mini, and I don’t regret it all. Form factor is goated."
1426,I feel so validated I'm not a phone addict as I'm rocking a 12 mini and have 50% battery at the end of the day. (weird flex but ok :)  My laptop addiction OTOH...

1428,Fitted with the pro's camera would be just perfect!
1429,"I returned mine. I was excited for the easy one handed operation, but in reality it’s so hard to type on, watching videos is too small, and the battery sucks. The max is too big, but the 6.1” model is a perfect balance of it all for me, can still use it with one hand pretty easily and videos are big and battery is great."
1430,[deleted]
1431,Still rocking my 12 mini with no plans to change any time soon.
1432,Loved my 12 mini but the battery SUCKED
1433,I had the iPhone 13 base model and simply found it way too small for my usage and therefore got the pro Max! I use it as a media player in the car and the base model was simply way too small for me. All about personal preference.
1434,"Went from 13 Pro Max to 13 Mini. Such a good decision! Using it is so easy and I don’t fear of dropping it and my hands don’t get sore from holding it too long. Battery life is trash tho, that’s why I carry a Magsafe Battery Pack in my backpack. I only put it when I know I’ll be out for a while."
1435,I’m still using my SE 2 and it’s started getting comments from people amazed at the size. Dreading when I have to replace it.
1436,"My only issue with the iPhone 13 Mini is that the default UI (not just the text size) is too small, and somewhat smaller than the UI on the iPhone 5S and iPhone 8/SE 2020/2022 which sucks.

Yes, I know Display Zoom exists and it DOES make everything much easier to use with one hand, however the UI is too big. There’s simply no option for making the UI and text just a tad bit bigger, but not too big.

That’s my only gripe with the iPhone 13 Mini. Everything else is fine. It’s a good size, but drawbacks like that is the reason why I got the iPhone SE 2022 instead. The default UI and text size is much better and it is just easier to use with one hand. Not to mention the control center on the iPhone SE comes from the bottom and not the top right corner.

If only Apple actually made the UI much more optimized for the Mini sized screen."
1437,"My hope is that once they revise the iPhone SE in 2024. It will be produced with body of the iPhone 13 mini, like they did with the iPhone 8 , as the SE always had to be „a step down“ from the normal iPhone. Also the SE had the smallest screen. I know so many people who are mad at Apple for discontinuing the 13 mini."
1438,I’m still rocking a 12 mini and love the form factor
1439,"Welcome to the mini gang. It seems there aren’t that many of us as Apple decided to shit on us after just 2 cycles of products. I’m not going to buy another iPhone until I can’t get another one that’s similar in size. They have to

Can’t really hold any big phone in my hand after this. Perfect size"
1440,"I’ve just changed from a 12 mini to the iPhone 14 Pro Max (I was used to the size as before the PM I had an S10+.). I loved the size of the 12 mini but the battery was awful and a real let down and in recent years, I’ve started watching more YouTube so the small screen just wasn’t cutting it."
1441,i have a 14 pro max (ik pretty far out) and held a 13 mini the other day it was actually REALLY. i like little phones. but at the same time i love big ass phones
1442,"Yep. I just switched from a 12 Pro Max to 13 mini a couple months ago.  My work phone is a standard 12 and suddenly feels HUGE and actually uncomfortable. I ca t believe I went for 2 whole years with a phone even bigger than that.

Having said that, the battery life does kinda suck. But I picked up an iPad mini 6 around the same time and that does all of the big screen and big battery things for me."
1443,"I to really like my 12 mini, a perfectly sized pocket smartphone with good cameras, screen and processor.

Also, why are you guys all watching videos on your phone, don’t you have a tablet?"
1444,Eyes are more important than hands....the bigger the better.
1445,"Yeah, hope the 15 will have mini size."
1446,"the perfect smartphone size^* ^for ^me

As much as I love small phones, the broad generalization that smaller is best doesn't ring true for everyone.  Hell, that's why we're in this mess in the first place because marketing folks thought we only need one phone size to rule them all and allowed big phones to take over the world.

Phone size is an ergonomic factor and we all deserve choice in this regard."
1447,"I've been holding onto my iPhone SE1 since 2018. And this phone is mostly perfect in every way. Fits perfectly in the hand (and pockets), has 128GB storage, a 4K camera, Touch ID, LTE, GPS, a headphone jack, a hotspot, Apply Pay, WiFi Calling, and you can single-handedly touch the opposite corner of the phone without having to awkwardly reposition the phone in your hand (crazy, I know). As far as I can tell, it is literally one of the most practical phones that have ever been made. The only problem now is that the battery life is declining and the 2GB RAM is starting to become noticeably slow. And I have also been noticing evidence of potential microphone quality throttling specifically during phone calls, which is the main purpose of a phone. The microphone quality is amazing in videos and voice recordings. So it might be software throttling to push people to buy a new phone. The main reason I have not upgraded my phone is because Apple and Android manufacturers have yet to make a phone like it. I would settle with the 13 mini if it had a fingerprint sensor, and even be willing to be extra for it, because no one makes a phone like the iPhone SE1 anymore. Apple completely did away with the mini line thinking that nobody wants a smaller phone. I think what's more likely the case is that people who are practically minded may go for a smaller phone and are also less likely to upgrade their phone every year. Also, some of us don't care for Face ID and love Touch ID. The iPhone SE1 is so perfect besides maybe the bezels (which I can deal with), RAM, and battery life. On modern phones, you can't even single-handedly reach your thumb to the opposite corner without awkwardly repositioning the phone in your hand. How is that convenient and how are people dealing with it? I don't get it. I want a phone, not a tablet... LOL. Phone sizes and car designs are really perplexing these days, among other things. It feels like the world is going backwards."
1448,"I had the 12 and 13 minis and swore I would never give them up.

Then I went to DisneyWorld and the smaller battery really made itself known.

When my carrier had a crazy trade-in deal for the 14 Pro, I snagged it.

It felt huge and heavy for the first few weeks to where I was about ready to return it. But I stuck it out and it eventually felt normal.

Now whenever I pick up my daughter's 13 mini I can't believe how tiny it is...and how I spent 2 years with that size."
1449,"It may be a great size but the iPhone SE is a great shape (better feeling round sides).

Now if we had a phone that combined both, that would truly be the perfect phone."
1450,"It’s not been discontinued, the 13 mini is still sold new from Apple."
1451,Time for the reminder that the small iPhone 12/13 Mini has a bigger screen than the original 'phablet' Galaxy Note.
1452,I think my next will be a mini. Big phones are mainly easier to drop for me. It’d be cool if you could take a small mini iPhone and plug it into a larger screen at home that just acts as a monitor.
1453,I adore my mini! I can’t use a giant phone with my little hands. So perfect and honestly the battery works for me
1454,"If the 12/13 Mini had had a headphone jack, I would have bought it in a heartbeat. So I'm still using my SE 1, the last iPhone with that jack. (Yes I have wireless headphones, that's not the point)"
1455,Tbf I’m 5’8” and my hands are pretty standard for my height. I can rock a regular size 12 with one hand. But that’s just me. I’ve never tried the mini but I do wonder what it would be like.
1456,"I love the small form factor of the smaller phones.
Displays have gotten a little bit big and if you’re trying to scan something in and let’s say you’re using a reading package or mobile application, you can work better with it using a smaller phone."
1457,"I have a iPhone 13 Mini, I love it. My hands are small, I stretch to reach the edge of the 13 Mini I consider it the perfect phone for me. I also loved the form factor of the the iPhone X."
1458,"I tried, but someone with huge hands, I think pro max is the only option I have"
1459,I bought a 13 mini instead of a 14 because I prefer the size. I won’t replace it unless the come out with a similarly sized phone
1460,"never understood why they don't make one size for the standard model and 3 sizes ( mini, normal, max) for the pros. loved the mini but sadly never had it cuz only the pros get new features. now they deleted it & skipped the SE this year. bad times for small phone fans."
1461,I like the idea but the Mini size of phones physically hurts my hand to hold as it is so small. I am a Pro Max user though so I am obviously not the target demographic.
1462,"i have a 12 mini which is basically the same phone, and i entirely agree. the main reason i still use an iphone is because of the mini; when this thing dies i'll probably head back to android"
1463,"Bought an iphone 12 pro. My son's phone broke and I gave him mine and got a 13 mini. I love it. So easy and fits in your hand. The camera is better on the pro, but unless I'm traveling I don't care. Newer phones are too big."

1468,I had it for a while and I loved the size! Perfect. But the battery just wasn’t cutting it for me. It was at like 70% by 9am when I had barely used it.
1469,No one cares

1473,"I honestly think it may one day come back under a different name of sorts. Kind of like iPhone SE. 
an iPhone SE mini perhaps ? I don't know. 


What i do know is that most of the articles online discussing iPhone Mini's death all seem to have some odd resemblance to male genitalia size frustrations that are being channeled into a phone of all things. 

Back when iPhones were small, they also cost a heck of a lot less than they do now. Even the newest SE is cheaper than the cheapest Mini. 

With a small phone, the people that actually prefer it over the others really care more about it being a modern communications device first and everything else second. Which was great when they did not cost as much as they do now. But now, if the same person were to look at the price of the Mini and consider what they're buying it mainly for, it would seem overpriced. That is because, it does not revolutionize the primary reason why they buy a smartphone in the first place and are not exactly the best option for vast amounts of media consumption. All the while costing a premium. 

My prediction for the foreseeable future is, once the cheapest mini becomes cheaper than the latest SE, you will see sales for them increase dramatically. Simply because, people that prefer smaller iPhones will need a replacement and or upgrade for their current.

Edit: typo and paragraphing."
1474,"They need to make an iPhone nano the size of the last full screen iPod nano. Give it basic functionality, text, calls, calculator, music. No App Store, or smaller App Store a la watch store. Market it to people who want to disconnect and parents with children."

I use it for keeping score at my kids’ baseball games and the hotspot data for live streaming the games using my MEVO Start cameras. 

It really is a comfy phone to hold, but you’re right about the battery. I have to keep a power bank in tow with me if they have more than 2 games a day."
1485,Not really discounted… I don’t thing it really needed the A15 chip like the 14 & plus. I bet in a couple more years you will see that mini refreshed
1486,"I love my 13 mini. Got it late last year as a replacement for the 8 I’d had forever, because I wanted something a bit nicer than an SE, while still maintaining roughly the same form factor that was easy to one-hand.

I had no issue with a battery life going thru whole days and end up with 50% daily as I’m not really a social media consumption kind of guy …. Mostly I go with YouTube for 1 to 1 1/2 hour only and some cases Spotify for 2 hours the most …."
1490,I like it. Got it for my kid and kinda of jelly of it. But they need to bring the mini back. I understand it intrudes on the SE line but.
1491,I currently main the iPhone 13 mini. It’s going to turn into my secondary as I transition to s23 ultra category. I just can’t get rid of the phone doh. It’s too good lol. So ima pay it off and keep it lol
1492,I wonder when apple will remove it from the store? Since you can still buy it new.
1493,I would LOVE the mini to be continued!!!!!!!!
1494,"Love the size too, but I’ll choose a bigger, better battery every time, which usually or always equals a larger phone."
1495,Sadly the battery can’t last me a day. Upgraded to 14pro and never looked back.
1496,"I have a 13 mini and I love it. I won’t upgrade til they have a phone in a similar size because I cannot go back to have a giant phone that doesn’t fit anywhere, including my hands"
1497,"If they had a mini with the pro camera setup I’d be a mini user. I loved the iPhone 5 and my
wife has the 13 mini but I really wanted the better camera setup as my phone has basically replaced my DSLR for anything but the most formal photography now."
1498,"i’ve been using the 13 mini since march last year.  the only issues i have are battery life (i leave 5G off) and some apps are not scaled properly for the smaller display, but other than that it’s been great. 

my main gripe with this phone is the lack of USB C, but that’s just Apple being Apple i guess."
1499,"Well, you can still buy it now. It may have been discontinued but I wouldn’t pay too much attention to it. Get what you want now and worry about it later."
1500,"""Bring back small phones!.."" tried the s23 base?"
1501,Love my 13 mini. Written with one hand without having to shift it awkwardly while holding it 👌
1502,I have the 12 mini for 8 months and i like it a lot. Sure the battery life isn’t the best but it’s not a huge problem for me. Before i had only android phones and by this time of use i always had a desire for a new phone… not in the case of 12 mini
1503,Its a bummer that Apple has discontinued the mini series…Using my 13 mini since launch and boy I can’t go back to the bigger sizes. Gonna be tough battle ahead.
1504,I have a 12 mini and there better be a mini out once this one breaks in a few years
1505,I have the 12 Mini and if they ever stop selling the 13 Mini I will grab one of the last ones so it can last me until someone else makes a phone in that size.
1506,"Same here, mini was a perfect form factor. Unfortunately, couldn't get 13 mini at my place."
1507,too small for me since i consume lot of streaming apps . base 13/14 is perfect
1508,"Coming off of a SE2, this is the exact reason I got one."
1509,"I owned a pixel 4a, one of the smaller phones. But personally I started seeing 99% people around me using a larger screen (may not be high end flagships as most lower end ones have big screens too) and couldn't resist moving to a larger phone. As streaming and visually everything needs a bit larger display . 6.1 is a must I think personally."
1510,"The 13 Mini hasn’t been discontinued yet, you can still buy them brand new from Apple, they’re still making them."
1511,"Agree, gonna keep my 13 mini for as long as possible. It’s the perfect size, and still bigger than older iPhones used to be. The only downside is battery life but even with 7-8 hours screen time a day I don’t need to charge until later in the evening."
1512,I was actually upset that 14 didn’t have a mini. I wanted the smaller phone for convenience.
1513,Exactly! I finally switched from 5S to 13 mini and I Love it! It fits in many small size pockets and is not too heavy! They need to bring back smaller phones.
1514," For me, Xs more handy"
1515,I’m hoping this size will return once we got advancement in battery tech.
1516,I’m going to get crap for this but… No you’re the perfect smartphone size!
1517,I have one unused & happy to hear people like it because i need to sell it but keep forgetting 😅
1518,I don’t know why everyone assumes the line has been discontinued entirely when the iPhone SE and iPad mini are examples of infrequently updated but extant product lines.
1519,"Yep, recently traded my 12 mini in towards a 13 mini with max storage so I can ride it out as long as I can. Even the regular-size phones just feel huge to me, and I’m a tall dude with big hands.

I just like that I can pretty much access any area of my phone with my thumb on the hand I’m holding it with."
1520,"I love the size of my 13 mini, but I think I get why it’s getting discontinued. Haven’t had it for a year, battery is already at 85%, and I often need to charge it more than twice a day. It’s just not functional for a lot of people. Then you have people -including me- wishing they would make a Pro mini, but battery would be ridiculous."
1521,"It definitely is, but my big thumbs only just use it. The SE 1st gen was also my favourite phone of all time."
1522,"The thing is, phones anyway will never present media in a comfortable size. So rather than compromise with 6""+ displays let's have the benefits of a handy phone ;)"
1523,"I've got my 13 pro and sometimes debate whether or not I want to up the size or down the size. I like one handing my phone but I find myself on media alot too, or using it to control media. 

I need to stop looking at social media so much anyway so maybe a smaller screen will discourage me from doing that."
1524,"I love mini’s had three so far. Never not once owned a large iPhone, they are so easy to keep. I love iPhones so much."
1525,"I don’t see any sense in a phone that’s so big it barley fit in your pocket and so heavy it pulls your pants down. If you can’t get though a day on a 13 mini battery you’re on your phone too much anyway. It’s ridiculous to constantly shell out hundreds for these phones when they literally do the same thing, the mini is by far the best one Apple offers."
1526,"Lighter and smaller than my old iPhone 8, yet it has a bigger display and everything is better about it. This is innovation."
1527,"The only thing I don’t like about the Mini is that the text is a little bit smaller so it’s little more hard to read, and this is because something to do with the native resolution of the phone."
1528,"Ive been eye'ing the 13 mini long before black friday because I wanted a small phone coming from my Xz2 compact. I went for the pixel 6a because of an unbeatable price, but I still feel its a little too big every time I use it... Theres nothing like the mini right now and i hate it"
1529,[deleted]
1530,"Not to take a way from your point as it is totally valid. However, what is a mobile phone “power user”?"
1531,"Pixel 5 also, what a great phone."
1532,"I find the battery life to be pretty good.   I had a 12 mini before (I wouldn’t normally upgrade so quickly, but since they’ve gotten rid of the mini form factor, I decided to get the last of them), and the battery life on the 12 mini was disappointing.  The 13 mini is much better, though."
1533,Probably wouldn't last anywhere near a day for me then.
1534,"For me nearly 2 years in the battery isn’t holding sadly. I wouldn’t say I’m a power user at least not the first year but now I’m using it more for work and such it’s not strong enough sadly, it overheats sometimes too which slows it down on occasion as a result and typing on the keyboard is a bit difficult at times.

My experience the battery hasn’t really been that much better than the 12 mini. It’s an improvement but to a huge degree - if they do a new mini the only way to really justify a sale for current users is probably going to be a much bigger or improved battery.

I love my mini, it is almost the perfect size a lovely throwback to the 5s and such. But I’m leaning now towards the normal model just for a bit more size and battery. But a phone will never fit as well in my pocket as the 13 mini. Just perfect."
1535,Give me a sightly thicker 13 mini for longer better life and it's perfect.
1536,"Absolutely same. I use it as my work phone and the 14PM as my personal phone, but now I’m thinking of transitioning over."
1537,This is where I’d consider having a battery case.
1538,You are mining Bitcoin on it? My iPhone 7 lasts the whole day
1539,I'm very happy with the battery life of my 13 mini.
1540,"TBH a 14 Mini would be not much different from a 13 Mini, since it would be a small version of the regular 14 rather than the Pro."
1541,"Battery life on the 12 mini was frustrating, but it’s great on the 13 mini."
1542,I downgraded from 13 Pro to 12 Mini and the battery killed me. Ended up going to 14 Pro within 3 months. I’d love the form factor but how much better can the 13 Mini’s battery be?
1543,"The battery life was the tipping point for me that made me decide to upgrade.  I had my Mini for a year.  I loved the size in my pocket but it wasn’t as ideal for extended phone usage as I would experience slight eye strain.  I could have increased font sizes but then it really would limit what you could see on the small form factor.

I repurposed my old mini for a home phone line."
1544,From what I’ve heard all those problems were fixed in the 13 Mini.
1545,it wouldnt fit in the housing.
1546,"That would reach the space where the wireless charging coil is. Then that would have to be moved down. Then the MagSafe wallet wouldn’t fit. It‘s not reasonable to fit such a big camera in such a small phone.

Besides that, all iPhone photos from the past few generations look the same anyway don’t they. They all have this horrible overprocessing so a bigger sensor is no use if the processing makes it look like a kids toy camera."
1547,That’s the only think that really got me to change was the camera.
1548,I’d rather have the 48 and the telephone lens instead of the ultra wide
1549,"Ive had a 13 mini since new and I agree. It’s great for your pocket and travelling.. I have never dropped it and I forget it’s even in my pocket. 
I find the battery fine. last me the day and it charges back up quick.
Speakers are good too. 
But it is quite small/narrow and I stuff up keyboard typing all the time. I am a tall person though.."
1550,The best answer
1551,"You put into words exactly what I do, thank you"
1552,"Me too, except my battery is shitty now 😬 do they make aftermarket 12 mini batteries with more capacity?"
1553,Did you upgrade?
1554,Much improved on the 13 mini.
1555,Different strokes and all that but I’m happy with my text size set to “all apps” at 85%. Means I get what feels like a real line of text when using safari etc.
1556,"There was a crazy sale for Iphone 12 Mini recently so I purchased 256gb and sold my 128gb version. Now have 100% battery life double the space and $8 extra in my pocket and 3 months free service! woo best deal ever!!

Just holding out hoping Apple releases Iphone 15 Mini! Especially since Iphone 14 PLUS did worse then 13 Mini in sales! woooo"
1557,"started with the 14 pro max, then for shits and giggles switched to 6s, then decided i am better off with 13 mini. gave my wife the 14 pro max and haven't looked back since.

everytime i hold the 14 pro max and i think how we are conditioned to hold bigger and bigger phones. damn thing felt like an ipad"
1558,"Same.

Except from 12 mini to 14 pro.

I fucking LOVED the 12 mini’s size. I think for just a casual phone that doesn’t do much else besides some games and being a phone, the 12/13 mini is the perfect size. 

But I wanna read more and play bigger games so the 14pro was my step up. 

I miss the light weight and size :’)"
1559,"This right here is exactly why I didn’t mind giving up my S22 Ultra. I still have a Tab S7 to watch content on. Sure, my 12 Mini works in a pinch. But most people have *at least* a phone and either a tablet or laptop, some even have both. You can use a smaller phone, and still have bigger screens for content consumption! :D"
1560,Nah the screen on the Mini is plenty big enough for watching videos and reading text.
1561,What do you mean by this?
1562,Discontinued because there's no 14 Mini.
1563,"[Except it doesn’t really.](http://www.displaywars.com/5,3-inch-16x10-vs-5,4-inch-d%7B19,5x9%7D) Larger diagonal, yes, but with the different aspect ratio the Note is much wider and about 14% larger in area. And the width is the real killer of one-hand usability IMO."
1564,My 13 Mini has exact same display size as my mom’s 6S+ ! That used to be the largest size iPhone Apple produced not that long ago.
1565,Get an Apple dongle stick it to the headphones and leave it there. It going on 5 years since they ditched the headphone port. You should adapt FFS. It’s beyond tired at this point. I did so and bought a dongle that has a lightning port and a headphone jack.
1566,"God like. I can also handle a regular 12 (don't have one, actually use a galaxy s10e) with one hand. But every time I have my wife's mini in the hand, it's just perfect."
1567,"I saw a video saying that they might use the old, unused bodies, of the 12/13 Mini to make the next generation of SE. Whenever that may be 🤔
Makes sense if you think about it. The first SE being in the body of the 5. The 2020 being in the form of the 8."
1568,Whenever they manage to sell all units they manufactured before it got axed.
1569,"I like some of the MagSafe battery packs from Anker. Keeps the phone juiced up, and can even double as a stand in some cases 😁"
1570,It's still quite a bit bigger than the Mini.

1572,Asus Zenfone 9?
1573,I just got mine 2 days ago from Verizon omg it perfect everything about it is great the cameras are amazing

1575,"Have you tried enlarging the systems font or any of the other stuff? I personally have turned on Bold Text to make every letter of the UI Bold and stopped the keyboard keys from showing lower case after typing in a capital. If you ever wondered why smaller iPhones used to be easier to use, try these settings"
1576,"For real? Except there wasn't any ""iPhone 3""... ... it was iphone 3G, for being the first iphone with 3G, followed by 3GS, and then moved on to iphone 4 with the current flat sides design"
1577,A term people use to justify their addiction
1578,[deleted]
1579,"12-14 hrs a day of gig work 7 days a week. Perhaps I’m not a power user from a performance needs perspective, but the Max screen def helps my old ass eyes when I’m looking at the thing for most of my waking/working hours."
1580,"The other replies to this thread aren’t necessarily wrong, but I’d love to provide my take on the mobile power user.

Phones these days are capable of quite a lot. And in my line of work, design, we use them regularly for all kinds of tools — mostly revolving around the camera. The cameras and processing these days can be invaluable to take convenient cam scans of sketches and stimulus without the complex workflows of setting up DSLRs and transferring photos. We also use them extensively for video calls when we need to show off prototypes — much easier to aim a phone on a teams call than try to fit it in a laptop webcam or set up a video stream from a camera. Not to mention off-site visits for larger manufactured prototypes. Video calls and taking lots of photos day in day out can be one way of having heavy usage of highly power consuming features on a phone — that’s completely separate from being addicted to a game or social media."
1581,"I see it as someone who uses maps, video calls, taking pictures, social media, etc. all in one day. I got the mini and it sucked the battery just from using maps. I really liked the size but unfortunately it didn’t work out for my use case and had to replace it with the regular 13."
1582,Someone who doesn't know a world exist outside of their phone.
1583,OP should have said “heavy user”
1584,"I’m a mobile app developer and my girlfriend is currently across the world so we use FaceTime a lot. So between work and my relationship, I’m using my phone in some way or another for most of my day. That feels power user-esque"
1585,"Someone who uses power, calculated in milli-amps."
1586,"i think it depends on what you do with it. i don't watch videos or play games & my 12 mini gets me 9+ hours of screen on time on a single charge, which is close to 2 days for me."
1587,"I carry a small Belkin MagSafe PowerBank that I just add to the back of the phone when its down too much. So far I only needed that when hiking and tracking my route.

I find that an acceptable trade-off, since I only have to increase the weigth (and size) under specific circumstances, while I can enjoy a small phone in 95% of the time."
1588,"I’d say the battery level is very close to the one of an iPhone 12 and quite a lot better than the 12 mini.

Seeing how tiny are the improvements on smartphones now, and the outrageous storage upgrade prices from apple I’m think I’m gonna ride my 512GB 13 mini till iPhone 19/20 if a mini is not released before then."
1589,"user of iphone 13 mini here for about 6 months now. i will never understand how do you guys use up so much battery.

do you browse reddit/ watch videos every waking moment?

i do a full charge every 2-3 days. most of my charging come from my commute to work while using carplay"
1590,Think in tests it got a couple hours more screen time which put it on par with the regular 12.
1591,Yes.  Battery life on the 13 mini is much better than on the 12 mini.
1592,"I can confirm this. Have owned both, and the 13 Mini is a great improvement. Worth the upgrade to get the newest mini now that it’s discontinued"
1593,not with that kind of attitude
1594,There isn't a best answer
1595,It's all relative!
1596,"Nope, same device."
1597,"i use a 13 mini but it still is not good, otherwise its the best phone ive ever used so far, only if the battery was a bit better"
1598,Video fine...blue screen effect on eyes deteriates vision for reading....Hope you can say the same in -10 years.
1599,"They literally couldn’t improve it any further? It’s got the 12 Pro camera, better battery over the 12 mini and better modem etc. There’s no room inside and the 14 range is very similar anyway. Discontinued means no longer produced, which it is still made and sold by Apple."
1600,"I tried to adapt. I owned a newer iPhone without a headphone jack for over two years but couldn't get used to it. The dongle with both lightning port and headphone jack is super bulky and it doesn't solve the issue of always wondering where it is (because I use the headphone jack for more than just one thing).

I understand I'm in the minority, but I consider my older phone with this feature built-in superior and it still works perfectly fine for me."
1601,"So back in the day I had a s9 and my brother the s9 plus, which seemed to big for me and were similarly sized guys. When I went to get a new phone they wanted a deposit of the s10e and the xr was just sales tax. So I got the xr, loved it, and then they announced the 12, same screen size, smaller bezels. Winner winner chicken dinner."
1602,"Anker is a phenomenal brand. I don’t like the idea of having to rely on a battery bank, however and only want to use one after heavy use or in an emergency.

Seems like with the Mini iPhones even moderate use will kill the battery quick."
1603,"galaxy s23 dimensions- 146.3 x 70.9 x 7.6mm

iphone 13 mini dimensions - 131.5 x 64.2 x 7.65 mm.

the actual difference between the 2 units is negligible. it does not matter what the diagonal screen size is."
1604,Zenfone 9 is the smallest premium specs Android phone but is unfortunately bigger than the iPhone 13 mini by a meaningful margin.
1605,"I didnt want to go for it because of the price, allegedly bad camera and bad OS support"
1606,"Couldn't agree more. Recently I was forced to leave my galaxy note 8 behind, and so upgraded to a new iPhone 11 and it's still mad to think I don't need to carry my charger everywhere with me"
1607,Power user sounds a lot better than gacha game addict
1608,"Yes but my phone drains insanely fast,even though i only play for around 2 hours a day at max,the phone gets hotter than your typical gaming laptop and battery is usually in the 20s from 79 and its a 2d td and RTS game"
1609,I use my phone waaaaaay less than that and find the 13 mini battery insufficient. It sucks because I love the phone otherwise. Most of the time it’s fine for me but on a rare day I use it as much as you describe it’s near death by like 4pm.
1610,While what you’re saying is true. We all know Stacey chose the iPhone 14 plus because she needs battery for scrolling tik tok and posting on  insta all day.  Same for little Jimmy who wants to play Call of Duty all day at school and home and needs that power.  The percentage of people like you is small in my opinion.
1611,this
1612,you used to be able to say obese users but noooooo. it's not politically correct anymore. thanks Obama
1613,This is also my solution. MagSafe battery pack is very convenient!
1614,charging and discharging so often also means battery will need replacement much sooner
1615,"Did you go 512GB for future-proofing with the intention of keeping the phone for a long time? That’s why I went 256GB, even though I’m currently at about 57GB used so the 128GB would have been fine for a long time. When it became apparent the 13 Mini was going to be the last small iPhone for the foreseeable, I knew I’d be sticking with it long term, unless they do something *really* impressive."
1616,"Yeah it’s definitely better battery life than the 12 mini.

I usually keep my phones for three years, but the 12 mini couldn’t make it to my bedtime and it was annoying (especially when traveling).

Best Buy had a very good trade-in deal for a new unlocked 13 mini, so I took it (basically came to $70 to upgrade). The 13 mini is the perfect (IMO) small-factor phone."
1617,"Try using maps for navigation, that will make you charge every day"
1618,Still not full day battery though.
1619,Nice. Just got the 13 mini and considering returning it due to iPhone 15 lol
1620,[deleted]
1621,This is not a phone meant to play games to begin with

1623,"Good call. Those people are out there, but that’s a hilarious justification. “Um, like what if I work in a nuclear reactor but hafta listen to pods all day and Pokémon Go?”

Don’t but a Mini I guess. Battery life ain’t great. Going to want to keep that in mind if you need to like do some spelunking while also streaming video."
1624,Which magsafe power bank you use?
1625,My 12 mini 128Gb was filled to about 115 and I wanted to upgrade the storage and decided to go for the 13 mini 256 but then on Amazon there was a deal were the 512 was only 30€ more expensive than the 256. No brainer. Currently have 178GB filled
1626,I basically only charge my 13 mini going to work (30-40ish min drive) and rarely have battery issues
1627,"Na, not the time I would be getting a new phone. The event next week is likely the iPhone 15 launch event (never mind its happening on the 15th). Though I doubt you will get your hands on an iPhone 15 before the end of the month. Rumor is this will be the USB-C release, if so I may actually upgrade. I like having less things, and not keeping a lighting cable is one less thing to have."
1628,happy cake day
1629,"Oh yeah I almost certainly won’t need more than 256GB within the useful life of this phone but if I’d seen it for that price, like you say, no brainer."
1630,"My wife works in an office in a different city. A lot of traveling via Public transit. By the time she’s home, and around 7-8 pm she needs to plug in.

For the size of the phone I think that’s pretty good. A trade off of the form factor."
1631,I thought 256 would be setting me for a long time but I’m glad I had that opportunity I’m just so free with taking 4K 60FPS videos and having all my music downloaded so I never worry about data reception when hiking for example.

1645,"Hey you kind of stole my idea for my homelab...
Well I mean putting it into a Kallax shelf.
Mine will have different components though.
I like the way you use the walls to mount components.
Good job!"
1646,I'm trying to start off with small with 1TB nextcloud
1647,I run unRAID on my Qnap. I recommend running unRAID on your QNAP
1648,That door... Needs to go....
1649,I'd consider getting a UPS with safe shut down for the nas enabled with that sort of setup. I ended up with bad sectors after a power outage on my last setup.  My QNAP picks up my APC through USB and safe shut down after 20 mins.
1650,"Nice setup! Can I ask why you are still using the hue hub if you have home assistant? I'm in the process of building my new home server and I'm going to get home assistant  with a zigbee dongle with the hope of getting rid of all my hubs, isn't it how it works?"
1651,"I really need to start considering a qnap nas to expand or way to do backups.. really, just haven't looked in to them"
1652,"When I first read your subject headline, I read a Sfx porn homelab server. Haha. Looking good."
1653,Looks great. Are you using NFS for jellyfin and other services?
1654,"I like this a lot! Since I don't have a room where to put my stuff it is all in my (still living with my parents....) The Kallax is a good thing, i'll guess i buy one for my tiny homelab"
1655,72TB? Assuming the data isn't important then.
1656,What’s the point of the external 18TB? Also I’m definitely going to “borrow” a lot of your ideas
1657,"I’ve quickly replaced my FRITZ!box since it was annoying and didn’t support all the stuff I wanted. I’m now running OPNsense as a VM on my proxmox machine.

Another nice thing would be a Grafana and influx/Prometheus/whatever setup. This way you can display some nice graphs. I’ve mounted a small and cheap tablet to my wall.Proxmox supports InfluxDB as a metric storage. Im not sure if it’s compatible with Prometheus. But my experience with influx is quite mixed. I just haven’t had the time to replace it with Prometheus."

1662,"This is a nice set up. What's the total power draw on it like? I'm planning a downsize of my current homelab running proxmox/proxmox backup, POE APs, IP cameras etc. on some old dell servers. Currently pulling around 240w 24/7 and trying to get it down to nearer 100w."
1663,Would you mind saying how much this cost to build? I was thinking of setting. Similar system up in my place.
1664,">My future plans including adding 10G through the homeservers USB 3.2 Gen2 Port.

I've got a device with USB 3.2 Gen 2...added a 5gbps adapter. Tops out at like 3.5ish. Kinda disappointing considering price of 2.5 vs 5 gbps adapters.

You'll need thunderbolt to get to anything near 10 I think."
1665,What are you using Mango for? (And which Mango?)
1666,I wondered this as well. Looks like it's for recipe management   https://tandoor.dev/
1667,"Hot tip: search ""selfhosted tandoor"". I had to do that for like half the stuff OP is running and it gets useful results."
1668,"Oh that's cool. What GPU are you using for the cloud gaming servers? What games are you playing and how is the latency?  
That's a lot of electricity :D   
But to be fair, my gaming rig uses 200-400w on its own, so maybe I should switch to a low power desktop x cloud gaming servers as well:)"
1669,"On the right, out of the Kallax, there is a NAS build with UNRAID in a Fractal Design Node 804, ASRock MB with intel J4125, 32Gb ram and 12 disk (4 2.5 and 8 3.5)."
1670,"Damn, that is an impressive setup!   
The Kallax is a very versatile little guy. Mine is 2x2.  
Homelab is in the left side (cut the panel in between out and mounted an exhaust fan + fan controller in the upper part) while power delivery is in the bottom right. The upper right space is home to a plush kitty which guards my spare drives."
1671,"Yes, a lot of us don't have the luxury of a basement or a hobbyroom - so we have to become creative, right?  
Nice setup and have fun with your new PC once it shows up!  
Thanks :)"
1672,"We only hear the Enterprise HDDs from time to time. But my gf and myself like it? With the sound it won't get too quiet in our apartment. Maybe it needs more air, a new fan or some dusting off?"
1673,That's a great tip for every QNAP owner. I knew of these attacks before I bought it and never enabled uPNP and the likes. The only thing connected to the internet is my homeserver (only one port though).
1674,Thanks a lot!
1675,"Phew, that will be hard since we only have a 1,5 room apartment and UPS tend to be quite noisy."
1676,"It ain't all about the size of the boat, it's about the motion in the ocean ;)"
1677,since I need some space for snapshots there is only 69TB of porn 👀
1678,"Sorry Chief! Which components are you planning to use for your setup?  
Thank you very much!"
1679,"I'd try the Kallax shelf idea, but do you need a fan in there to keep things cool?"
1680,"That's a great start! But be careful to not bloat it with too many apps ;)  
I think about remaking mine. I'd like to put the data from my NAS onto on one of my SSDs through an m.2 adapter."
1681,Unraid won't run on ARM cpus?
1682,"There's active cooling in the back with two 120mm BeQuiet Silent Wings 3 PWM fans & fan controller.   
What other reasons might there be to remove the door?"
1683,"Oh, I haven't had the time to properly set up everything in my home assistant. Currently I only record the power consumption of a couple of devices (fridge, oven, pc, infrastructure and tv setup) in the internal db. I also installed graphana and influxdb but didn't set it up yet."
1684,"Sounds like you didn't buy one yet. Please stay away from QNAP - their software is bad, buggy and a hot security mess.   
If you want a prebuilt system you might want to look into Synology. In case you'd like to host docker containers you should prefer one with an x86 instead of ARM CPU. They might need a little more power but quite a lot of docker containers aren't compatible with ARM CPUs.   
DIY builds are cheaper than prebuilt though (who would have guessed), which comes at the usual cost of less support and usually some troubleshooting while setting everything up. Linus made a pretty good video on that topic."
1685,"Haha, nice. Thanks mate!"
1686,"Thanks mate! Yes, some of my debian containers have smb-cifs installed to access the NAS via cifs v4."
1687,Thanks mate! I hope you have a jigsaw to make some holes for good airflow. Otherwise it could get a little toasty in there.
1688,"It's backing up one of the NAS volumes!   
In case you need some more details for your build just ask :)"
1689,"Yes, I have a backup of everything important. Thank you for your concern tho!"
1690,"The whole infrastructure (Homeserver, NAS, Router, Fans, HueBridge, Switch) is 70W! Since my infrastructure smartplug only reads out the whole power draw I can only guess and say the NAS should be around 20-30W.   
Yea old hardware can pull a lot of power, that's why I opted for more powerefficient  CPUs (the NAS has an ARM CPU and the Homeservers 4800U is a Notebook CPU)."
1691,"Consumer stuff draws less than commerical (and is obviously cheaper). Laptops even more so.  If you don't need bleeding edge performance, Get a Lenovo T470/Dell Latitude/HP etc.  You can get quad/six core, add 32-64GB RAM, native intel lan and on but idle power draw in the single digits.  Obviously the NUC here too, but that's more $/£/€.

Currently I'm slimming too - was running a SuperMicro board with Kaby Lake era Xeon, 48GB, a 24 port LSI card and 22 big HDs (all 12TB+).  That would idle around 59w running 3 vms, generally about 70w when streaming media and 90w when thinking about something.

I've moved the servers (Music, Roon etc) onto an old thinkpad (X1) - 8th gen quad core, 16gb, SSD and a 5tb WD USB drive.  That idles 3-4w.  Playing with LightsOut that I used a decade ago on the big server so it can turn on the 2-3 times a week I play films and go to sleep after.

My networking gear was over 100w - a bunch of Ubiquiti stuff that drew 113w including 2x cameras, 2x APs.  That's down to 53w (15w is the cable modem) with no loss of functionality, think there's another 10w to go if I get a newer switch (ironically that will save me money as the old 16 port POE sells for more than the new lite one)."

1694,"10g over copper eats power, 20w for the card plus 3-4w a port at each end.  It's crazy. 5gbps is just a subset of 10, and likely to be retired as there's no cost differential to 10 so nobody uses it.  The 2nd gen of 2.5G stuff is coming through now with lower cost and lower power use (Intels TDP went 2w->1.3w).

If you've got PCIe get old SFP+ and optical modules (30 each on ebay for the cards, 7-8 for the modules), they are around 4-6w for the card with the modules.  My Mikrotik CRS305 uses \~ 7w for 10G switching with 4 modules in it.  Plus optical is just cooler.  30m cables can be had for 10-15 each."

1700,"im using a Tesla k80, whihc to the best of my research is like two 2070 stuck together so i give each VM one, and it has 24GB graphic ram so each VM gets a 2070 and 12gb of DDR5 graphic ram,

I have 40GB of ram per machine and and around 2TB over ISCSI

Latency is near enough non existant, but please keep in mind im not doing gaming E-Sports and im streaming via steam  and Parsec.

My brother is using his VM in Denmark and the hardware is in Ireland in my house.

As far as games ive not had any issues with games everything runs on high. 

Ive had more issues with games not suporting the CPU in VM rather than graphic card. Deathpooland the Void engine doesn't like the K80 but there is apparently a workaround for that.

1706,"Well I am about to complete my homelab ARMy:
- rpi4 4GB ram
- rip3 4GB ram
- pinephone 3GB ram
- pine64 quartz64 8GB having a pci-sata controller for raids
- one 8 port gigabit switch.

On the pi4 runs traefik and gitea.
The pi3 is just a drone CI worker.
The quartz64 is gonna be the ""cloud""/NAS.

Unfortunately I fried my current quartz64 by accidentally putting it on one HDD with metal casing... The short probably was caused by the USB3 power lanes routing the current right into the soc... The replacement will arrive tomorrow. I also ordered clear coating the prevent that from ever happening again. I felt soo dumb...

Also I want to use a glass door so one can see all nice blinken lights.
And the most cool config will be with the pinephone:
In case my internet fails the traffic will be routed through the pinephone's 4G modem.
But therefore I need to flash openwrt on the router in order to config the routing appropriately."
1707,"Well since I do not make a ton of computations it's fine without any fan.
I have a CM4 what the IO board that has a fan onboard and a quartz64a with a fan.
One Pi4 and one Pi3 and one Pi2 all passively cooled.
I drilled 2 holes in the back of the inlet that holds the glassdoor so there can some ventilation happen.
The active cooled devices never get hotter than 55°C and the passive never get warmer than 65°C.
So that's all fine.
But it might be a nice project to build an ventilation solution using an adurino and a temperature sensor and fan."

I was searching for an enclosure even in furniture shops bot none had something decent. It never came in my mind to look at the kallax measurements"
1714,"So looking at what you're running 24/7 if I added in the IP cameras and APs, it should just scrape in under 100w total. That's very useful to know. Thanks."
1715,"I think you’re underestimating the NAS power draw.

Generally, hard drives takes around 7-9W, and your particular model consumes 8.35W active, and 4.16W idle. That means the drives alone will consume 33.4W when active, and add to that 5-10W for the NAS itself, and you end up at a more reasonable 40-45W active, and around 20W idle.

That lines up nicely with what my Synology 918+ uses with 4*8TB WD Reds, which uses around 45W active (Intel CPU).

When electricity hit €0.5/kWh I turned my NAS off, and instead opted for a single USB drive connected to a Mac Mini M1 (4.6W idle). My total power consumption from the network rack is 61W active, and with electricity frequently hitting €1.2/kWh these days, that turned out to be a great decision."

1719,"I couldn't tag you for some reason, but I posted a list on the upper level comment!"
1720,"There's some bugs in both the first gen Intel (i225) and Realtek (8125) kit - intel are up to B3 stepping which fixes most.  You can get those on pcie for \~ €14 on aliexpress (similar USB as a guess).  Not sure if home use would ever uncover those bugs, but who knows.

The Intel i226 are coming onstream now, last casual glance at Ali didn't show any pcie cards.

Ali express also have 8 port 2.5G switches getting close to €100, keep an eye on [servethehome.com](https://servethehome.com), they review a lot of this stuff with a great focus on power use too.  I suspect the 2nd gen chipsets for switches etc should come along soon that should fix a lot of the power worries and drop pricing.

I did a lot of monitoring of power use on my setup - actually saw drops putting my IoT bits and pieces down to 100meg connections, especially those on long cable runs like security cameras that didn't need gigabit, so right-size the speed where you can."

However, Im experiencing input lag over home network with parsec.. which i have no clue on why is it happening especially that server is connected through LAN, tv through LAN, laptop to the 5G (speedtest on laptop pulls ~800mb so speed its good).

1736,I bought it on Mindfactory (german online shop for hardware). They only ship to german addresses though.

1738,"no worries i may do the write up just so i dont forget it, look me up when you're ready if you have further questions etc."
1739,yup you are correct but it is powering two VM's so thats ok in the grand scheme of things and i have two E5-2696 v4 in there at 145W each so yeah not very low power system but again its two cloud gaming machines.
1740,"I don't think anyone knows for certain.  I'm pretty sure I read of several examples of qlocker getting on peoples NAS with none of that enabled.  This even led to some speculation of it possibly being an ""inside job"" (QNAP developer or something), but to be fair to QNAP there's obviously no evidence to substantiate such a claim so... who knows.

In any event, I choose not to trust my data to any of the NAS vendors.  I rolled my own ITX NAS with an LSI SAS controller, a bunch of surplus HGST SAS drives, Linux, OpenZFS, SAMBA, docker, etc etc and maintain all of it manually.

1764,I've been working on an DIY friendly and [open source ](https://smallformfactor.net/forum/threads/rcc-big560-diy-edition.16587/) SFF case design (RCC-BIG560-DIY) that would fit up to three 280mm radiators. This is a quick build I did for testing my prototype - nothing fancy but it was fun to put together.
1765,"Want. Even top+bottom 2x280mm at that volume would be great. Looks like it would be a bit more comfortable to put together than the smaller dual rad builds in the cooler master nr200 and ncase m1.

Aesthetics could see some improvement from my point of view. Countersunk screws on the top panel would be nice. And the vent patterns look a little... diy. I guess smaller holes up the manufacturing costs?"
1766,Reminds me of the winter one it's not is it?
1767,The big question though ... temps?
1768,Looking forward for this one!
1769,Would this fit a FTW3 with waterblock?
1770,No need for bending after cutting?
1771,"few things you should look into.  
The spacing on the bottom, should check and measure distances in which airflow is affected. there is a good chance that the feet are not tall enough and restrict airflow into the case.  
this is a Huge issue that's not spoken about very much. A lot of manufactures moved away from Fans behind glass for the front. but then never raised their cases up enough when Putting fans on the bottom of the case. the O11D is a Big offender of this. 

was the case made around the Rad's? it looks like there is ZERO clearance on any of the rads which leads me to believe that the only model rad that's going to fit is the one shown in the pictures it seems like an oversight but if you intend to sell these you should Ensure Compatibility with as many 280's as you can.

Love the concept. I also feel you might have done better squatting the Case down and pulling it in the front so you can have front Rad intake Side I/E and top as exhaust. Leaving passive intake venting for the bottom."
1772,"I just saw the Winter1 video, and thought ""this is the case I want, but without some of the flaws"".

The BIG560 may be the answer.

Do you ship to international destinations? How does one place a pre-order?"
1773,This is the very expensive case right? I saw the review by Optimum Tech.
1774,"This seems like an amazing case. I’m interested in size and compatibility. I’d love to know more info as it comes out. It would be great if there was magnetic dust filters that cover those holes. It would restrict airflow, but I dont like the big holes visually or for concern of dust buildup since my room accumulates dust quickly.

Id also like to know how you built it. Did you do custom CNC or medal work or is it stuff you can get from a hardware store?"
1775,"Thanks for your feedback. Yes indeed, it's pretty easy to build with only two rads, plus you gain a lot of space for a reservoir and/or decent pump.

Yeah, the panel design is not for everyone. But: I have open-sourced the drawings. If you come up with a vent pattern that suits you better you just need to modify the drawings I made and send them to some metal workshop for laser cutting."
1776,"Nope, my BIG560 design doesn't have much in common with Winter One - except large round vent holes maybe  ;)"
1777,I just watched OptimumTech's Winter1 video this morning and thought for sure it was the same case.
1778,I'll let you know when I'm done with leak testing - had one faulty fitting
1779,Clearance is large enough to fit an RTX3090FE without waterblock. What's the dimensions of the FTW3 with waterblock?
1780,Nope. You can build it without any bend parts - but for that build I made some optional brackets for mounting the PSU in the front instead of the rear.
1781,"Thanks, appreciate your feedback. 

Currently using 16mm tall feet which can be extended to 18mm. I also have 25mm available if that should be to limiting for airflow. 

The case fits almost all 280mm / 30mm thick rads, except for X-Flow.

Already did another case with front / side rad some time ago. Wanted to try something different this time."
1782,"Well, the BIG560 might also come with minor flaws but it doesn't cost that much...

Yes, I do. First pre-orders already sold out. Might consider a second batch if there should be interest."
1783,"Nope, it's my own design (RCC-BIG560) and definitely more affordable than Winter One."
1784,You can check the full story and build log here: [sff.network ](https://smallformfactor.net/forum/threads/revoccases-rcc-big560-custom-bto-case-maximum-flexibility-for-high-end-hardware-in-20l.16507/)
1785,Maybe if you made a version of the panels where a Demci filter can be neatly slotted/stuck on? That might be a neat solution.
1786,Yeah that must be it 🤣🤣
1787,I’m glad he reviewed it. He’s the itx king of YouTube. Sadly he didn’t have many good things to say about it and I have to agree. The price and all the little issues pushed me away for good.
1788,"It would be an incredibly tight fit I think. The EK FTW3 block is about 314mm, a little less if you take off the decorative trim piece. It's also about 155mm tall, not sure what your case will accommodate in that dimension."
1789,The side radiator panel also doesn't need bending?
1790,Oh.. okok looks similar from this angle haa
1791,"Sure, all possible with that design - could also make a window panel if going for dual rad only."
1792,"Yeah, saw this case and thought the same. Hopefully this case won't be $400+ like the Winter One case."
1793,"For sure. I just cannot justify the $500 for hardly any case, let alone a teeny tiny one. At least on some of the gigantic cases it starts to make sense when you're actually getting tons of extra space and accessories."
1794,Length would fit fine but it's too tall. Max would be 149mm.
1795,"No need, it's a flat part. BTW, all those brackets are optional. If you want to go the simplest and cheapest way you can just mount the rads to the panels directly. You see the slots I made there?"
1796,well yeah - we both use round large vent holes and aluminum with anodized finish - but a totally different layout and price tag
1797,"Yup, looks good! Are these extruded parts for the main frame? Are they standard parts?"
1798,"Also, I assume I'd need to mount the PSU where it is in this configuartion to have an air cooler on the CPU?"
1799,"Yep, extruded aluminum profiles. I've put together a part list and the drawings: [here](https://smallformfactor.net/forum/threads/rcc-big560-diy-edition.16587/)"
1800,Can't seem to be able to reach the page with the drawings. Do you have a direct link?
1801,Currently not. For me and others it's working fine. Mayb you need to register first to be able to download?
1802,That's probably the case (aye)
1803,Never going back to a 'normal phone' ever again
1804,Normal phones are too big to use one handed. Fold has great one handed outside screen and then bonus of tablet inside
1805,"The phone I used before the Fold 3 was a Surface Duo. 

Already with the Surface Duo I said I can't go back to a ""normal"" phone, however I'm not sure if the Fold Series of Phones is the one I'm sticking with 'till eternity. I do wish the Fold would be wider."
1806,"Prior to the Z Fold 3 my main phone was an LG V60 with the dual screen case, and when the dual screen case crapped out on me, I switched to a Surface Duo for like a week before I dropped it once on its corner and got a hairline fracture down one of its screens. 

Then the Z Fold 3 launched and I pulled the trigger on this thing pretty much immediately. I really don't wanna go back to a single screen phone any more than I wanna go back to a single 16:9 monitor on my desk.

It does occasionally feel like some wild hipster shit that pretty much all my devices (headphones, keyboard, pens, phone, 32:9 ultrawide monitor) are incredibly non-standard, but I'm not an asshole that expects companies to find it practical, let alone profitable, to cater to people in the likely less than 1% of the market with these non-standard devices, so I'm pretty okay when there's some jank going on, and I'm pleasantly surprised when shit works flawlessly."
1807,"Got the Fold 3 since release and can say that I will not be going back to a regular phone. I'm always constantly using my phone and I'm a huge mobile gamer. Never had an issue like others had on the subreddit, but I do hope they improve a lot of things for the future versions of this phone."
1808,"I'm looking to hold on to my Fold 2 until around July. Would make it a year I've had it. I like it, it's pretty cool tech, but I think I'm ready to go back to a regular phone. Have my eye on the S21 Ultra or possibly the Pixel 6 Pro. Never had a Pixel but Samsung is so hard to get away from."
1809,"I love my fold. But Samsung isn't giving them enough love. Much bigger batteries. More storage. Innovate the design. If you go back to the first fold to the 3 not a whole lot has changed. The idea of the S Pen on board is cool, but for me not enough."
1810,Undecided. Do really enjoy my fold3.
1811,Been on Samsung phones for past 8 years and love the fold but looking forward to having an iPhone agaon. I love the fold3 but I have to carry an old iPhone 6 around as well for work and I can't get over how snappy it is and the camera is just... Better. And this is an iPhone 6 ffs.
1812,I just want a wider cover display
1813,"Yeah there are huge issues with the Fold series and folding phones in general. But I just can't see myself going back to a slab phone again. The Fold offers a superior 1-handed experience (folded) and a superior large screen experience (unfolded) for both media and work.

I can't go back."
1814,"Even with the flaws of the fold 3, I literally could not go back to a regular phone. In future its going to be a question of ""which folding phone do I get this time?"""
1815,"It totally depends on the phones that are out by then;

but i would for sure miss the big screen.

edit: I'm still a bit sad that i haven't gotten a nice cover for my fold 3.

All the covers i see are  either looking nice but arent flat on the backside when unfolding or they are just cheap looking. For real who in their right mind buys a plastic cover that looks like cheap childen toys?

right now Iam going with the spigen slim armor pro; its secure for sure but way too big"
1816,Can't go back to normal phone after using the fold 3.  It would be unacceptable downgrade not having a big unfolded screen
1817,"Me, I want to try something different everytime, so what ever is the next big thing is what I go for."
1818,"Great question, I get asked all the time and I would never not have a fold. I'll carry 2 phones if I have to."
1819,"On a personal level it's darn near perfect for my life. I can honestly get rid of my TV and just get some nice Bluetooth headphones, other then a Bluetooth controller for emulators.
I have a 3 and I love it."
1820,I'm due for an upgrade this year. I have the fold 2. I will see what happens this year. It doesn't have to be a foldable. I'm liquid. I wonder what it feels like to go back. 🤔
1821,"For me the main three main issues with the Fold 3 is the typing experience regardless of which screen I use, software (App compatibility) and finally battery life. Unfortunately to me these three main issues are the main requirements of any phone. I will most like likely be switching to normal phone next year if these three main issues are not addressed in future Fold."
1822,a slab will be a secondary phone
1823,No option for both. I go back and forth. If I anticipate heavy media consumption coming up or studying I break out the fold. It gets used less overall as well which is a good thing I think.
1824,"I will hold onto the fold 3 for awhile however that S22U feels great in the hand and seems awesome, whenever I check it out at bestbuy."
1825,"I still daily drive my ""normal phone"" (13 Pro Max) and I would never go back to solely running a candy bar again."
1826,I still have my S9+ which i use to browse or watch videos before going to sleep. It's hard to do that with the Fold. I wouldnt want to doze off and it hits my face or i drop it on the floor. Candybar phone with a popsocket makes sense sometimes. But Fold for everything else.
1827,"I left my fold z at work and I'm using my Note this weekend. I can already tell the difference. 

Will not switch back to candybar phones"
1828,"The only thing that has me tempted to going back to a traditional form factor is the number of people who's folds inner screens break for no reason and warranty gets rejected. Aside from that, i love everything about the fold. Just hope future variations are more durable or samsung starts sticking to their word on things"
1829,I will not go back to a slab phone. The folds are going to get better with each new device .
1830,"Can't cease the crease! Anything else feels primitive or boring. I hope that doesn't come off as elitist, just the idea of going back to something traditional just wouldn't excite me anymore."
1831,"They only things that bother me is that outside screen typing is super hard and inaccurate most of the time. Inner screen is inaccurate at times.

The last thing and only thing that *may* make me consider a candy bar phone again would be if apps are never optimized for the inner screen."
1832,As much as I don't like the deal with samsung not covering warranties I have loved my fold better than any other phone. I hate carrying around my iPad because it's too big and I need a bag or something to carry it. My fold can fit in my pocket. I love the size of the inside screen it's perfect for one hand holding and drinking a hot cup of coffee in the other when I'm watching a show or reading some ebooks.
1833,I believe most people with folding phones still have slab phones as back up. My ZF3 is my main phone now but I use my Pixel 6 Pro when I expect to take a lot of pictures. Plus I have a MS Duo for when I need real multitasking that the ZF3 can't provide me.
1834,never going back to a normal phone now I love my fold had fold 1 2 and 3 now
1835,I'll never go back to a regular slab phone. I love the fold form factor.
1836,"traditional for now, unfortunately"
1837,"I use my fold daily and love it. If Im having a beech day or plan to fly my drones and need a screen I use my backup phone. Also I might be alone in this but I'm a bit of a retro game geek. The folds inner screen is the perfect ratio for that. Stick it in a vice style Controller = retro heaven. Also has anybody played psp on this thing, I swear with everything maxed out it still doesn't drop a frame and it looks simply amazing, so good infact my friend didn't believe I was playing psp."
1838,"I have a Fold 3 if they make the outer screen bigger i may but if job ill be switching back next year, especially since they have a Note replacement now"
1839,"Actually went back already. I never realized until I had it that the reviewers of the Fold just had bigger hands than I do. I haven't found it comfortable to hold and changed it for an S22U, because the S Pen was a huge draw for the Fold for me."
1840,I could never move back
1841,"I'm hoping rollable phones will be a thing in the coming years so i can get the best of both. 

For now I'm on the fold and will switch to whatever I feel gives me a nice change. Foldable, New OS, whatever it is, I just want something more between phones other than a new SoC and better cameras. Phones have gotten quite boring besides foldables in recent years."
1842,The only thing I don't like is you can't see all videos on social media most look cropped.
1843,I get use to use the fold form and can't imagine return back to normal form factor
1844,Hopefully more accessories and repair centers take future folds.
1845,"I'll never go back. Hell I'm still plagued by the t mobile service issue (not as bad) but I still refuse to switch. I used to the outer screen now and feel like it's the perfect size a majority of the time. And when I want, I can pop it open and have a mega screen to watch tv/movies with my gf or kids."
1846,I love the fold 3 but the damn screen protector that always bubbles and can't take off because it'll void your warranty is super annoying.
1847,"Could never go back to a 'normal' phone again - Things are so much easier both personally and for work using the larger display when needed (RDP, SSH, web browser, remote management tools, etc) without needing to get my laptop out and general use on the outside display where its smaller and easier to use single-handed."
1848,"I didn’t think I would enjoy the fold form as much as I do. Mines gone back to Samsung for the screen to be fixed. Im using an iPhone 13 Pro now until it’s back, lovely phone, but I really do miss the amazing inner screen of the Fold. I even like the thinner outer screen when folded, much more pleasant for 1 handed use."
1849,This is the way
1850,"Agreed, don't know if that future is always gonna be the Z but it's never gonna be a normal phone"
1851,Fully agree. It's amazing.
1852,"Yeah I see a lot people think the width is too small but I think it offers better one handed usage.  That said, I find myself mostly using the outside screen and occasionally use the inner screen."
1853,Im ready to go back too. Its a neat phone but its got a gimmick I use 10% of the time. The other 90% of the time its just a heavier phone with a shittier battery
1854,"Yeah there is a lot of things that samsung does so right with hardware, abs the tweaks in one ui are very under rated. I went from a note to a pixel a few years ago - lot to like about the pixel but I also realized just how good samsung is at hardware...."
1855,"It should have been integrated from the beginning. These are phones that are begging to have one included. Moreso than the Note phones before it.

I tried to love my Fold, but simply put for myself, the screens are just too small overall. Inner screen is too small to be a great tablet, but really too big to used as a phone and the cover screen is just not a pleasant experience to use beyond checking notifications."
1856,You can make your samsung more snappy in dev settings :) you'll have to Google it as I can't remember the exact steps but it works great if we're thinking of the same snappy
1857,yes this is future. (Unfolding sound)
1858,"I traded my N20U for the Fold3. When the S22U came out for pre-order, I planned to give up the Fold3. S22U came in and I used for 2 days. It is the same as N20U just different cameras. I sent it back. 

Will probably just wait for the Fold4 to upgrade."
1859,"I am dually. 13PM and S21U. The fold3 is a safe queen. I say a little prayer before opening it, lol. Will probably save it to trade for the 4 for possibly better tech, and lighter battery."
1860,"I've had mine since launch day, still no inner screen break. Knock on wood."
1861,"The fold 3 is ever so slightly bigger than the iPhone Mini. If people complain about the Fold being small, I bring up the iPhone Mini.

Edit:
Bigger -> wider"
1862,"One hundred percent agree. But it is cool to be able to say us willing to use these are the reason so much cool stuff is going to exsist in a few years. I love mixing it up in the crazy stuff to be able to say ""We used the first folding phones, so your welcome for the amazing rolling or fully collapsible phone in your hand""!! Lolol"
1863,Yes! Sorry for commenting on an old thread but you can definitely make android feel super snappy by disabling all the useless animations in developer settings. It translates into apps and stuff opening immediately without that quick default animation. I always disable those on my androids.
1864,kshhhhh 😎
1865,"My fold3 is insured with a $50 deductible so I’m not worried at all and use it just as roughly as my iPhone, it gets wet, dropped, thrown, etc., and it’s been held up perfectly."
1866,"Same here, fingers crossed haha!"
1867,"I've had, and lost, 3 SPen's since I've owned this Z3. I've been without one more than I've had one. It's too expensive to keep on replacing them, but it's what makes this device stand out. Integrated SPen would be enough for me to upgrade just so that I can enjoy my device to the full"
1868,Eventually this display technology will lead to phones that you can crumple up like trash.
1869,Who do you have insured it from?
1870,"Warrantylife through Swappa, was quite skeptical until they paid me back in full for my gouged inner display and cracked camera on my Fold2, only $5.99/mo and a $50 deductible is unbeatable, needless to say I was quick to get it on my Fold3"
1871,Thank you! Ill check that one out. I got my last phone from Swappa too.
1872,Clans of Caledonia. A medium-heavy euro in a box half the thickness of most euros.
1873,"* Oink's **Modern Art**, and Oink form factor in general. Great games that fit in your coat pocket.
* Smaller cards games have good gameplay/box size ratios. **Biblios**, **Movable Type**, **Forks**, **The Crew**, anything that a pack of cards, really.
* You can resize many social deduction games to a pack of cards as well.
* **Splendor** fits inside a deck box if you ditch the oversized box it comes in.
* Obligatory mention of **Hive Pocket**."
1874,**Burgle Bros** does an excellent job with this. The box is very compact and it's an amazing co-op game!
1875,"I'm not sure what qualifies as small, but . . . 

**Condottiere** \- Bluffing.  Bidding.  Just enough area control to help you decide when to contest most stridently and when to stick to the shadows.

**Arboretum** \- The tension arrives pretty quickly and there's good opportunity to pull the rug from underneath an opponent's scoring.

**Piepmatz** \- As in arboretum, it's a mix of promoting your own goals and working to undermine your opponents come end game scoring.

**Startups** \- I don't want that card, but there's so much money on it . . . 

**Biblios** \- Push your luck, bidding, bluffing - even a bit of misdirection sometimes.

I've got quite a few small form-factor games and one thing I appreciate is that they mostly  seem to be high on interaction, far more so than lots of larger games.  They often have excellent card art and are an easy teach, which is important if you cart them around with you and get games going with new players.

Cheers"
1876,"Card games are favored here, but most of these go beyond your average amount of game:

-   For Sale (Travel) - exquisitely simple but endlessly playable.  The travel edition coins are chintzy card stock, but that's what it takes to keep the factor small.

-   No Thanks! - again, really simple, but very replayable.  My edition has very small plastic poker chips to keep it portable, but I'm not sure if that's true of the current edition.

-   Mottainai - a very big game in a small package.  Strongly best at two players, but five is also fun with two decks.

-   Innovation - another Chudyk game, I actually prefer this a bit to Mottainai but both are great.  A number of his other games could fill a slot here...Impulse and Glory to Rome are also great but slightly less portable.

-   Skull King - my favorite trick-taker, almost a standard deck of cards.  Stick 'Em, Texas Showdown or Voodoo Prince are also good but SK is the best all-around.

I'm sure lots of folks would also vote for Love Letter, although it's really not my bag.  I've also played out Coup, which is another microgame."
1877,The only small box game I have is **Set A Watch** but it's pretty good.
1878,"Box size is usually less of a factor for me than footprint when thinking of travel. A game like **Oh My Goods!** has a tiny box but it can sprawl out pretty wide once you get going. Same with **Innovation**, you need a lot of separate piles of cards."
1879,Tiny epic galaxies - but you can chceck other tiny epic games. Cartographers - pretty small box and great game.

1883,"Small and efficient: **Pax Renaissance** (first edition, not the new KS), **Glory to Rome**, **John Company**

Efficient: **Food Chain Magnate**, **1862/EA**"
1884,"**Brass** either flavour, retail version has a lovelt svelte box.

In terms of pleasure to size ratio **6Nimmt** or travel for sale"
1885,"**Palm Island** plays 1-2p without a board or table. It not only has a vanilla VS/solo mode, it also has 3 co-op levels that can also be played solo, additional coop shared cards, multiple VS modes using cards that can be gained into your deck, a set of feat cards that enter your deck as you achieve them, and a wallet for even more portable travel with a solo deck. The game can also be saved at any point with little save cards you put in front of your resources. I'm not sure if they're still available, but initially, if you didn't want the already very small and convenient little box the cards come in, you could get a waterproof one to really take Palm Island anywhere. And did I mention that the version they sell these days is the waterproof plastic cards version? They even upgraded the cards since the Kickstarter so that they're plastic but have a nice feel to them and don't slide around so much (I still have the original, but I'd buy another set in a heartbeat just to upgrade and play 4p). It's the ultimate travel game. Play in the car, on the train, waiting in line, in bed, on the couch, at the beach, underwater, and never run out of gameplay. Palm Island is hands down the best deal I've gotten for what I paid. The only game that comes close might be Love Letter or Innovation, also very portable, small box games.  

Not only that, Palm Island does scratch the itch that you see with some deckbuilding games like Dominion; the gameplay revolves around upgrading cards for two purposes - to use them for more resources, and to activate victory points. The order your deck is in will help determine how easy or difficult it is to manage this puzzle. Both because cards coming before others will influence what can be spent on which cards, and because you can't look at the deck after the initial shuffle and examination. So, you're meant to wrangle resources in a way that allows you to maximize their use. It's not technically deckbuilding, but it has a similar feeling of tableau/deck/engine building. Not only that, once you throw in the co-op mode cards (goals everyone needs to fulfil otherwise everyone loses), it has a dynamic similar to solo Terraforming Mars - in that mode, you have to terraform the planet but also want to score points. So in a way Palm Island scratches that itch as well. It definitely punches above its weight"
1886,"**Shards of Infinity** \- I find this more interesting than Star Realms and it plays really well competitively with 2 players. If you get the coop expansion you can fit it in the base box.

**Innovation** \- Perhaps the deepest game that fits in a book-sized box. Absolutely amazing.

**Joraku** \- Area control with some cool trick-taking action mechanics in a box smaller than a paperback book.

**Air Land and Sea** \- I carry the sleeved cards wrapped in a rubber band with me everywhere I go. A nice, tense 2 player.

**Crimson Company** \- Bidding on units to raid 3 castles, each unit has unique abilities. Good for bidding game fans as well as dueling fans.

**The Crew** \- Fun trick taking coop, lots of buzz right now.

**Condotierre** \- Bidding-Poker-Army-Bluffing with the Pope. This game is awesome and can play up to 6 which makes it a good add to a small box collection.

**Shipwreck Arcana** \- Deduction coop with beautiful art but can be steep for people who are challenged by mental math."

I believe it's out of print, but **Once Upon a Time**, which if memory serves had a detective relative as well, might qualify. **Wings of Spirit** is on the edge for me but I think it is decent in both packaging size and strategy for what looks like a light game."
1894,"Space Hulk: Death Angel. Holy shit this is an amazing game in a small package. Scratches the itch for RNG-and-skill based coops, with a fraction of the playtime and space. NOT recommended for solo play, RNG much less fun.

Blood bowl team manager is essentially a highlights reel of bloodbowl games, so it feels like it authentically compresses multiple games into just the plays that you would remember anyhow. Scratches the itch for a game that feels almost like a 'season', also the itch for Games Workshop's unique aesthetics/etc.

Guillotine and Bohnanza are also two smaller games that I basically always take to game nights."
1895,"**Oaxaca** does a great job at providing a full game in a small box.  Theres enough game here to warrant a full sized fold out board, full sized cards, etc.  But the designers used small cards and a playing mat that is just big enough.  It doesn't play like a small box game at all, feels like a normal sized game."
1896,**Impulse** is incredible.
1897,"Several of Sierra Madre games and Ion games fit this very well. Games like **Pax Porfiriana**, **Neanderthal**, **Greenland**, **Bios Origins** and more. Many of these have a bgg weight around 4."
1898,"[Bobail](https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=bobail) on Boardgamearena. It looks like there's no game there...and then you play it and lose, and play it and lose.

I'm going to make myself a physical copy some day."
1899,"I don't think any games in truly small boxes scratch the same itch as games that come in larger boxes.

something like Arboretum does a great deal with one small deck of cards, but its not exactly a substitute for Gloomhaven or Gaia Project.

there are some games more along those lines that have smaller boxes than the standard Ticket to Ride sort of size though, Root, Pax Pamir 2nd Edition, Clans of Caledonia and Brass all come to mind, but I'm sure there are others."
1900,"**Harvest**: it's a tight worker placement game in a small box.

**Ultra Tiny Epic Kingdoms**: like the regular Tiny version, but fits in the space of a deck of regular playing cards (and that *includes* the cubes!)."
1901,Port Royal and Incan Gold are great!
1902,I’m going to be genuinely upset when Juma finally releases the expansion and I won’t be able to fit it in the box.
1903,I want Oink's **Modern art** so bad but can't find the English version anywhere... I'm hoping for a reprint for either this or the stamp version also from Oink.
1904,[deleted]
1905,Agree on **Biblios** and **Hive**. :) (Haven't played the others.)
1906,Burgle Bros should be the gold standard for packaging efficiency.
1907,"Woah! I haven't played Piepmatz, but I love all these other games and you've peaked my interest! Thanks for the reccomendation!  


Biblios is so much fun and I love that you mention that there's a bit of misdirection. That's such a nice, nuanced part of that game"
1908,"I'm the opposite. When I say ""travel"" I mean largely toting it to other people's places and space once there has rarely been a problem, while I can only reasonably fit one standard sized game in my bag.  
That said, your suggestions would be great then. Do you have any for small footprint games?"
1909,"Cartographers looks fun, drawing as a gameplay element is pretty novel"
1910,"Yeah, I was gonna say Tiny Epic Mechs, I think the whole concept of Tiny Epic is just that: bunchs of fun and great games in really small boces and prices"
1911,"Yeah Tiny Epic Galaxies is great, a very small box and lot of fun, even include a nice solo mode and it have a nice expansion.

In general Tiny Epic games are exactly that, tiny boxes and very nice games."
1912,"This is a great suggestion, I enjoy Dixit and games like it. Thank you!"
1913,Thank you for this very detailed recommendation! You've well piqued my interest
1914,Isn't Innovation more like 1/3rd of a book in size?
1915,DSA is a big hit with even big gamers as a warm up game or restaurant game.
1916,"I got it on order through my FLGS, I think for $45-$50 Australian. The Crane Wife expansion was ~$30.

For me it's been well worth the price. Got a lot of play hours out of it and the components are some of the highest quality out there."
1917,"Actually because I'm a fan of the podcast *Campaign: Skyjacks*.  
Its setting and tone are inspired by the Decemberists, and Illimat both exists in-universe and inspires/facilitates a custom mechanic. They use the Luminaries as a sort of Tarot deck, representing the whims of fate and higher powers that affect the narrative.  

I understand the theming not necessarily grabbing you (though I love it), but underneath that is a super solid card game with some novel mechanics."
1918,"Just the sort of good design I was looking for, thank you!"
1919,"I would not expect to ever find a Gloomhaven equivalent in a convenient size. But a lot of games of moderate complexity are either inefficient in their use of space, like Dominion, or are just mostly empty box."
1920,"It would be very clever if the expansion box was oversized relative to its contents, namely, just the added thickness to fit the game and expansion so we can jettison the old box."
1921,"It's quite language independent, I grabbed the german edition and had no issues."
1922,I thought about swapping mine for the lovely CMON version but I couldn't get over the size of the box to game ratio
1923,I think they only have the license to sell it in Germany and Austria.
1924,I'm OG from the first very first Kickstarter campaign :)
1925,"I think the original is still the best, however the Tiny Epic line overall is quite decent."
1926,I've got the iELLO edition...
1927,"Wow, I never heard of this, thanks!"
1928,Shut up and take my money!
1929,"Yo, smart idea!"
1930,"No worries! It's one of my favourite podcasts, easily. And I listen to dozens."
1931,"That looks so clean! I've never seen this case, but I makes me want to build in it 👀"
1932,"Super happy with this build! Was worried at first that the 150w of the case was not sufficient for the processor, but so far I had no problems. Locked the PPT for the processor at 65w for now. The case itself feels really nice and solid, it's mostly metal.

Temperature is also nice, about 35 C° when idle and got a maximum of 75 C° under heavier work load so far.  I often read that people were complaining about the noise of these In Win builds, but the noise level is really fine for me. 

Here are all the specs:

&#x200B;

**Case**: In Win Chopin 150W

**Processor**: AMD Ryzen 5 5600G

**Ram**: 2 x 8 GB Corsair Vengence

**Motherbord**: ASRock B550M-ITX

**Cooler**: Noctua NH-L9a-AM4 chromax black

**Memory**: 500GB Samsung 970 Evo Plus NVMe"
1933,I will always upvote an InWin Chopin post on this sub. Beautiful little case.
1934,You can fit the alpenphon blackridge in there if your a mad lad
1935,Nice looking build. I was going to build the exact same spec build but had concerns over temps in that case so reused a matx case i already had.  How are you liking the 5600G? I use mine as a bedroom pc on a tv and could not be happier with that cpu.
1936,"Very nice! I like the mesh side panel of the Chopin. 
I was looking at exactly this myself but I decided to go with Asrock Deskmini X300 instead. Same cpu and cooler. The Deskmini only has 120W power but I hope it will still be enough."
1937,"Where can one get the Chopin?  Seems Amazon and Newegg all are being sold by 3rd party who are asking $180-$230 for it

Never mind, a quick search led me to their own store…"
1938,"why does the chopin look like it could fit a low-profile, single slot discreet gpu with a single dvi port"
1939,What temps are you getting on your 5600G? I just built the exact same machine last night and was wondering if my 50C idle temps are normal.
1940,"Hiya! Please post more details about your build! You don't *have* to post [80 pictures (each with captions!) like u/M1AF did](https://www.reddit.com/r/sffpc/comments/irlrg8/m1afs_ncase_m1_build_guide_c14s_and_deshroud/), but post more than just specs! Here are some (non-exhaustive) prompts for you: 

- Are the case's advertised compatibility numbers accurate?

- How easy is cable management? 

- How effective is the cooling setup?

- Would you recommend your parts overall?

- If you did a custom mod, how did you do it?

1941,Do you happen to know if a 5700G would've worked just as well?
1942,I can highly recommend it!
1943,Did you have to update the bios or was it good to go out of the box? Thanks in advance and I love your bed
1944,This is old but I can get the blackridge in but can’t get the side panel on as it catches? Any ideas?
1945,"Thanks! Loving the 5600G, it's incredible how moch bang you get for your buck."
1946,"The Deskmini X300 looks nice, too! I guess the 120w should be enough if you are not pushing the PC too much or overclock it. I hope it'll work out!"
1947,"No that doesn't seem normal. I'm getting between 35 C° when idle and about 75 C° under heavier load. Are you using the exact same cooler? Is the thermal paste applied correctly? 

I locked the wattage of my CPU to 65w max in the BIOS, maybe try that out. Although that should only really affect temps under heavier load."
1948,"yes, but go with Pro version of the Case as it has 200W gold rated PSU. 5700G will draw over 150W. cooling may become and issue too with PBO and GPU overclock. Stock should be fine."
1949,"I didn't update my BIOS, everything was fine out of the box."
1950,Where does it catch?
1951,"I am using the exact same cooler and the thermal paste application is perfect. I noticed that your cable management is a lot cleaner than mine though so I'm gonna go clean mine up a bit.

What's strange to me is that I would never go over 70C under full load, gaming and stress testing. So basically just really high idle temps.

Thanks for the response though! I appreciate it. I missed your comment where you talked about your temps.


EDIT/UPDATE: So this system had a preloaded Windows OS on the boot drive already when I built this system. I decided to do a fresh install of windows and everything, now I've got 35C to 40C idle temps. I guess the issue before was my 5600G was always on boost even on idle."
1952,The left of the side panel and left of the blackridge
1953,"Yes, maybe the cables are blocking the grid and prevent good airflow (If you can even call it airflow in that system lol). Anyway, hope you'll manage to get good idle temps!"
1954,You might be able to slightly push it down when you put the pannel on but I would look at some if the other threads I'll try and find the few I found awhile ago
1955,https://www.reddit.com/r/sffpc/comments/casxhe/chopin_with_a_blackridge_and_3400g_it_fits_with/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
1956,"One lad turned the side panel 180 and secured it with tape, another dude used the side panel as normal but took a hammer to the blackridge"
